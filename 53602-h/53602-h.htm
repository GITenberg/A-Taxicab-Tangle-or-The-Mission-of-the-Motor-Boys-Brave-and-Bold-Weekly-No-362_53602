<p>“For its size, pard, I reckon this is about the biggest
town on the map. We’ve been here five days, and the
traffic squad has been some busy with our bubble-wagon,
but if there’s any part of this burg we haven’t seen,
now’s the time to get out a search warrant, and go after
it. What’s on for to-day?”</p>

<p>Joe McGlory was the speaker. He and his chum, Matt
King, known far and wide as Motor Matt, were in the
lobby of the big hotel in which they had established themselves
when they first arrived in New York. In a couple
of “sleepy-hollow” chairs they were watching the endless
tide of humanity, as it ebbed and flowed through
the great rotunda.</p>

<p>For five days the gasoline motor had whirled the boys
in every direction, an automobile rushing them around
the city, with side trips to Coney Island, north as far as
Tarrytown, and across the river as far as Fort Lee, while
a power boat had given them a view of the bay and the
sound. Out of these five days, too, they had spent one
afternoon fishing near City Island, and had given up
several hours to watching the oystermen off Sound
Beach.</p>

<p>Matt, having lived in the Berkshires, and having put in
some time working for a motor manufactory in Albany,
had visited the metropolis many times. He was able,
therefore, to act as pilot for his cowboy pard.</p>

<p>“I thought,” he remarked, “that it’s about time we
coupled a little business with this random knocking
around. There’s a man in the Flatiron Building who is
interested in aviation&mdash;I heard of him through Cameron,
up at Fort Totten&mdash;and I believe we’ll call and have a little
talk. It might lead to something, you know.”</p>

<p>“Aviation!” muttered the cowboy. “That’s a brand-new
one. Tell me what it’s about, pard.”</p>

<p>“Aviation,” and Matt coughed impressively, “is the
science of flight on a heavier-than-air machine. When
we used that Traquair aëroplane, Joe, we were aviators.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged, professor,” grinned the cowboy.
“When we scooted through the air we were aviating, eh?
Well, between you and me and the brindle maverick, I’d
rather aviate than do anything else. All we lack, now, is
a bird’s-eye view of the met-ro-po-lus. Let’s get a flying
machine from this man in the Flatiron Building, and
‘do’ the town from overhead. We can roost on top of the
Statue of Liberty, see how Grant’s Tomb looks from the
clouds, scrape the top of the Singer Building, give the
Metropolitan&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s a dream,” laughed Matt. “It will be a long
time before there’s much flying done over the city of New
York. I’m going to see if we have any mail. After that,
we’ll get a car and start for downtown.”</p>

<p>McGlory sat back in his chair and waited while his
chum disappeared in the crowd. When Matt got back,
he showed his comrade a letter.</p>

<p>“Who’s it from?” inquired McGlory.</p>

<p>“Not being a mind reader, Joe,” Matt replied, “I’ll
have to pass,” and he handed the letter to the cowboy.</p>

<p>“For me?” cried McGlory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your name’s on the envelope. The letter, as you
see, has been forwarded from Catskill.”</p>

<p>“Speak to me about this! I haven’t had a letter since
you and I left ’Frisco. Who in the wide world is writing
to me, and what for?”</p>

<p>McGlory opened the letter and pulled out two folded
sheets. His amazement grew as he read. Presently his
surprise gave way to a look of delight, and he chuckled
jubilantly.</p>

<p>“This is from the colonel,” said he.</p>

<p>“Who’s the colonel?” asked Matt.</p>

<p>“Why, Colonel Mark Antony Billings, of Tucson,
Arizona. Everybody in the Southwest knows the colonel.
He’s in the mining business, the colonel is, and
he tells me that I’m on the ragged edge of dropping into
a fortune.”</p>

<p>A man of forty, rather “loudly” dressed, was seated
behind the boys, smoking and reading a newspaper. He
was not so deeply interested in the paper as he pretended
to be, for he got up suddenly, stepped to a marble column
near Matt’s chair, and leaned there, still with the
cigar between his lips, and the paper in front of his eyes.
But he was not smoking, and neither was he reading.
He was listening.</p>

<p>“Bully!” exclaimed the overjoyed Matt, all agog with
interest. “I’d like to see you come into a whole lot of
money, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t got this yet, pard. There’s a string
to it. The colonel’s got one end of the string, ’way off
there in Tucson, and the other end is here in New York
with a baited hook tied to it. This long-distance fishing
is mighty uncertain.”</p>

<p>“What is it? A mining deal?”</p>

<p>“Listen, pard. About a year ago I had a notion I’d
like to get rich out of this mining game. Riding range
was my long suit, but gold mines seemed to offer better
prospects. I had five hundred saved up and to my credit
in the Tucson bank. The colonel got next to it, and he
told me about the ‘Pauper’s Dream’ claim, which needed
only a fifty-foot shaft to make it show up a bonanza. I
gave the colonel my five hundred, and he got a lot more
fellows to chip in. Then the colonel went ahead, built
a ten-stamp mill, and started digging the shaft. When
that shaft got down fifty feet, ore indications had petered
out complete; and when it got down a hundred feet, there
wasn’t even a limestone stringer&mdash;nothing but country
rock, with no more yellow metal than you’d find in the
sand at Far Rockaway. I bade an affectionate farewell
to my five hundred, and asked my friends to rope-down
and tie me, and snake me over to the nearest asylum for
the feeble-minded if I ever dropped so much as a two-bit
piece into another hole in the ground. After that, I forgot
about the colonel and the ‘Pauper’s Dream.’ But
things have been happening since I’ve been away from
Tucson. Read the letter for yourself, pard. It will explain
the whole situation to you. After you read it, tell
me what you think. You might go over it out loud, while
I sit back here, drink in your words, and try to imagine
myself the big high boy with a brownstone front on
Easy Street.”</p>

<p>Matt took the sheet which McGlory handed to him,
and read aloud, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Young Friend</span>: I knew the ‘Pauper’s
Dream’ was all right, and I said all along it was the
goods, although there were some who doubted me.
Within the last three months we have picked up
a vein of free milling ore which assays one thousand
dollars to the ton&mdash;and there’s a mountain of it. Your
stock, just on this three months’ showing, is worth, at a
conservative estimate, five hundred dollars a share&mdash;and
you paid only five dollars a share for it! You’re worth
fifty thousand now, but you’ll be worth ten times that if
the deal I have on with certain New York parties goes
through.</p>

<p>“Now, from an item I read in the papers, I find you
are at Catskill, New York, with that young motor wonder,
Matt King, so I am hustling this letter right off to
you. By express, to-day, I am sending, consigned to the
Merchants’ &amp; Miners’ National Bank, for you, two gold
bars which weigh-up five thousand dollars each. Inclosed
herewith you will find an order on the bank to
deliver the bars to you. On Wednesday evening, the
twenty-fourth, there will be a meeting of the proposed
Eastern Syndicate in the offices of Random &amp; Griggs,
No. &mdash; Liberty Street. You can help the deal along by
taking the bullion to these capitalists, along with my affidavit&mdash;which
is with the bars&mdash;stating that the gold
came out of a week’s run at the ‘Pauper’s Dream’ with
our little ten-stamp mill. That will do the business.
Random &amp; Griggs have had an expert here looking
over the mine. After you show the bullion at the syndicate’s
meeting, return it to the bank.</p>

<p>“I am not sure that this letter will reach you. If it
doesn’t, I shall have to get some one else to take the
gold to the meeting. Would come myself, but am head
over heels in work here, and can’t leave the ‘Dream’ for
a minute. Wire me as soon as you get this letter. I
hope that you are in a position to attend to this matter,
my lad, because there is no one else I could trust as I
could you, with ten thousand dollars’ worth of gold
bullion.</p>

<p>“Catskill is only a little way from New York City, and
you can run down there and attend to this. Let me know
at once if you will.</p>

<p class="marginrightindent1">“Sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="marginrightindent">“<span class="smcap">M. A. Billings.</span>”</p></blockquote>

<p>“Fine!” cried Matt heartily, grabbing his chum’s hand
as he returned the letter.</p>

<p>“It sounds like a yarn from the ‘Thousand and One
Nights,’” returned the cowboy, “and I’m not going to
call myself Gotrox until the ‘Pauper’s Dream’ is sold, and
the fortune is in the bank, subject to Joe McGlory’s
check.”</p>

<p>“This is Monday,” went on Matt, “and the meeting of
the syndicate is called for Wednesday evening.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of time,” said McGlory. “I’m not going to
let the prospect of wealth keep me from enjoying the
sights for the next three days.”</p>

<p>“Well,” returned Matt, “there’s one thing you’ve got
to do, and at least two more it would be wise for you
to do, without delay.”</p>

<p>“The thing I’ve got to do, Matt, is to wire the colonel
that I’m on deck and ready to look after the bullion.
What are the two things it would be wise for me to do?”</p>

<p>“Why, call at the bank and see whether the bullion is
there.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to load up with it before Wednesday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Of course not, but find out whether it has arrived in
New York. Then I’d call on Random &amp; Griggs, introduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
yourself, and tell them you’ll be around Wednesday
evening.”</p>

<p>“Keno! You’ll go with me, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it will be necessary, Joe. While you’re
attending to this, I’ll make my call at the Flatiron
Building.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to hunt up Random &amp; Griggs, and I haven’t
the least notion where to find the Merchants’ &amp; Miners’
National Bank.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get all that out of the directory.”</p>

<p>“Then where am I to cross trails with you again?”</p>

<p>“Come to the Flatiron Building in two hours; that,”
and Matt flashed a look at a clock, “will bring us together
at ten. You’ll find me on the walk, at the point of the
Flatiron Building, at ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Correct.” McGlory put the folded papers back into
the envelope, and stowed the envelope in his pocket. “I
reckon I won’t get lost, strayed, or stolen while I’m attending
to this business of the colonel’s, but from the
time I take that bullion out of the bank, Wednesday afternoon,
until I get it into some safe place again, you’ve
got to hang onto me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be with you, then, of course,” Matt laughed.
“Now, let’s get the street addresses of the bank and the
firm of Random &amp; Griggs, and then our trails will
divide for a couple of hours.”</p>

<p>The boys got up and moved away. The man by the
marble column stared after them for a moment, a gleam
of growing resolution showing in his black eyes. Turning
suddenly, he dropped his newspaper into one of the
vacant chairs and bolted for the street.</p>

<p>His mind had evolved a plan, and it was aimed at the
motor boys.</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory decided that they would not use an
automobile for their morning’s work. The cowboy would
go downtown by the subway and Matt would use a surface
car. They separated, McGlory rather dazed and
skeptical about his prospective fortune, and Matt more
confident and highly delighted over his chum’s unexpected
good luck.</p>

<p>It chanced that Matt had spent some time in Arizona,
and he knew, from near-at-hand observation, how suddenly
the wheel of fortune changes for better or for
worse in mining affairs.</p>

<p>One of Matt’s best friends, “Chub” McReady, had
leaped from poverty to wealth by such a turn of the
wheel, and Matt was prepared to believe that the same
dazzling luck could come McGlory’s way.</p>

<p>Within half an hour after leaving his chum, the young
motorist was in the Flatiron Building, asking the man on
duty at the elevators where he could find Mr. James
Arthur Lafitte, the gentleman whom Cameron had mentioned
as being interested in the problem of aëronautics.
Lafitte, Cameron had told Matt, was a member of the
Aëro Club, had owned a balloon of his own, and had
made many ascensions from the town of Pittsfield, Massachusetts&mdash;which
was near Matt’s old home in the Berkshire
Hills; but, Cameron had also said, Lafitte had given
up plain ballooning for dirigibles, and, finally, had turned
his back on dirigibles for heavier-than-air machines. He
was a civil engineer of an inventive turn, and with an
adventurous nature&mdash;just the sort of person Matt would
like to meet.</p>

<p>Having learned the number of Lafitte’s suite of rooms,
Matt stepped aboard the elevator and was whisked skyward.
Getting out under the roof, he made his way to
the door bearing Lafitte’s name, and passed inside.</p>

<p>A young man, in his shirt sleeves, was working at a
drawing table. Matt asked for Mr. Lafitte, and was informed,
much to his disappointment, that he was at his
workshop on Long Island, and would probably not be in
the city for two or three days.</p>

<p>Matt introduced himself to the young man, who was a
draughtsman for Lafitte, and who immediately laid aside
his compasses and pencil, and climbed down from his
high stool to grasp the caller’s hand.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lafitte has heard a good deal about you,” said he,
“and has followed your work pretty closely. He’ll be
sorry not to have seen you, Motor Matt. Can’t you come
in again? Better still, can’t you run out to his workshop
and see him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Matt answered. “I’m in the city with
a friend, and he has a little business to attend to which
will probably take up some of our time.”</p>

<p>“I think,” went on the other, “that you won’t regret
taking the time to talk with Mr. Lafitte. He’s working
on something, out there at his Long Island place, which
is going to make a big stir, one of these days.”</p>

<p>“Something on the aëroplane order?”</p>

<p>The draughtsman looked thoughtful for a moment.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” said he, “that something was discovered
which had fifty times the buoyancy of hydrogen gas, that
the buoyancy could be regulated at will by electrically
heated platinum wires&mdash;would that revolutionize this flying
proposition?”</p>

<p>Matt was struck at once with the far-reaching influence
of the novel proposition.</p>

<p>“It would, certainly,” he declared. “Is that what&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m not saying any more than that, Motor Matt,”
broke in the young man; “in fact, I <em>can’t</em> say anything
more, but you take the trouble to talk with Mr. Lafitte.
It may be worth something to you.”</p>

<p>Matt lingered in the office for a few minutes longer,
then went away. The spell cast over him by the clerk’s
words went with him. He had often thought and
dreamed along the lines of the subject the draughtsman
had mentioned.</p>

<p>The drawback, in the matter of dirigible balloons, lay in
the fact that the huge bag, necessary to keep them aloft,
made them the sport of every wind that blew. If the volume
of gas could be reduced, then, naturally, the smaller
the gas bag, the more practicable the dirigible would
become. With the volume of gas reduced <em>fifty times</em>, a
field opened for power-driven balloons which fairly took
Matt’s breath away. And this lifting power of Lafitte’s
was under control! This seemed to offer realization of
another of Matt’s dreams&mdash;of an automobile flying machine,
a surface and air craft which could fly along the
roads as well as leap aloft and sail through the atmosphere
above him.</p>

<p>Carried away by his thoughts, Matt suddenly came
back to his sober senses and found himself staring blankly
into a window filled with pipes and tobacco at the
V-shaped point of the Flatiron Building. He laughed
under his breath as he dismissed his wild visions.</p>

<p>“I won’t take any stock in this new gas,” he muttered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
“until I can see it demonstrated. Just now I’m more interested
in Joe and his good luck than in anything else.”</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. It was only half-past nine,
and it would be half an hour, at least, before he could expect
his chum. Matt had suddenly remembered, too, that
it would probably be ten o’clock before Joe could finish
his business at the bank, and that would delay his arrival
at the Flatiron Building until after the appointed
time.</p>

<p>Crossing over into Madison Square, Matt idled away
his time, roaming around and building air castles for
McGlory. The cowboy was a fine fellow, a lad of sterling
worth, and fortune could not have visited her favors upon
one more deserving.</p>

<p>By ten o’clock Matt was back at the Flatiron Building.
As he came around on the Fifth Avenue side, a taxicab
drew up at the curb, the door opened, and a lad sprang
out. The youth was well dressed and carried a small tin
box.</p>

<p>Matt supposed the lad was some one who had business
inside the building, and merely gave him a casual glance
as he strolled on. Matt had not gone far, however, before
he felt a hand on his shoulder. He whirled around,
thinking it was McGlory, and was a little surprised to
observe the youth who had got out of the taxicab.</p>

<p>“Are you Motor Matt?” came a low voice.</p>

<p>“That’s my name,” answered Matt.</p>

<p>“And you’re waiting here for your friend, Joe McGlory?”</p>

<p>“He was to meet me here at ten,” said Matt, his surprise
growing.</p>

<p>“Well,” went on the lad, a tinge of color coming into
his face, “he&mdash;he won’t be able to meet you.”</p>

<p>“Won’t be able to meet me?” echoed Matt. “Is business
keeping him?”</p>

<p>“That’s it. I’m from the office of Random &amp; Griggs,
and Mr. McGlory wants you in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“What does he want me for?”</p>

<p>“That’s more than I know. You see, I’m only a messenger
in the brokers’ office.”</p>

<p>He was a well-dressed young fellow, for a messenger,
but Matt knew that some of the messengers, from the
Wall Street section, spend a good share of their salary on
clothes, and, in fact, are required to dress well.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine what Joe wants me for,” said the
wondering Matt, “but I’ll go with you to Liberty Street
and find out.”</p>

<p>“He’s not at the office, now,” went on the messenger,
“but started into the country with Mr. Random just as I
left the office to come after you.”</p>

<p>“What in the world is Joe going into the country for?”</p>

<p>“That’s too many for me. All he told me to tell you
was that it had something to do with the ‘Pauper’s
Dream.’ He said you’d understand.”</p>

<p>This was startling news for Matt, inasmuch as it
seemed to indicate that McGlory had encountered a snag
of some kind in the matter of the mine.</p>

<p>“We’d better hurry,” urged the messenger, as Matt
stood reflecting upon the odd twist the “Pauper’s Dream”
matter was taking.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Motor Matt.</p>

<p>Accompanying the young fellow to the taxicab, Matt
climbed inside and the messenger followed and closed the
door. The driver, it appeared, already had his instructions,
and the machine was off the moment the door had
closed.</p>

<p>“My name is Granger, Motor Matt,” observed the
messenger, “Harold Granger.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look much like a granger,” laughed Matt,
taking in the messenger’s trim, up-to-date garments.</p>

<p>Harold Granger joined in the laugh.</p>

<p>“What’s in a name, anyhow?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” answered Matt good-naturedly. “I’d give
a good deal to know what’s gone crossways with McGlory.
I suppose you haven’t any idea?”</p>

<p>“There are not many leaks to Mr. Random’s private
room,” answered Harold, “and I can’t even guess what’s
going on. Mr. Random seemed excited, though, and it
takes a lot to make <em>him</em> show his nerves.”</p>

<p>“Where are we going?”</p>

<p>“To Rye, a small place beyond Mamaroneck.”</p>

<p>“Great spark-plugs!” exclaimed Matt, watching the
figures jump up in the dial, recording the distance they
were covering in dollars and cents. “What’s the use of
using a taxicab for a trip like that? You ought to have
hired a touring car by the hour.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this was the only car handy, and Mr. Random
never stops at expense.”</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t he and McGlory have come by way of
the Flatiron Building and picked me up?”</p>

<p>“I think Mr. McGlory said you were not expecting
him until ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>“That needn’t have made any difference. Joe knew
where I was to be in the Flatiron Building and he could
have come for me.”</p>

<p>“He and Mr. Random seemed to be in a hurry,” was
the indefinite response, “and that’s all I know.”</p>

<p>When the taxicab got beyond the place where the
eight-miles-an-hour speed limit did not interfere, the
driver let the machine out, and the figures in the dial
danced a jig. But Random &amp; Griggs were furnishing
the music for the dance, and Matt composed himself.</p>

<p>“You’re a stranger in New York, aren’t you?” Harold
inquired.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been in the city for a long time,” Matt answered.</p>

<p>“This is the Pelham Road,” the messenger went on,
“and that’s the sound, over there.”</p>

<p>“I was never out this way before,” said Matt,
“but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Just at that moment something went wrong with the
taxicab. There was a wobble, a wild lurch sidewise, a
brief jump across the road, and a terrific jolt as the machine
came to a halt. The body of the car was thrown
over to a dangerous angle, Matt was flung violently
against Harold Granger, and both of them struck the
door. Under the impact of their bodies, the door yielded,
and they fell out of the vehicle and into the road.</p>

<p>Malt had given vent to a sharp exclamation, and his
companion had uttered a shrill cry. The next moment
they were on the ground, Matt picking himself up quickly,
a little shaken but in no wise injured.</p>

<p>The taxicab, he saw at a glance, had dived from the
road into a stone wall. The driver had vanished, and
Matt took a hurried glance over the wall to see if he had
landed on the other side of it. He was not there, and
the mystery as to his whereabouts deepened.</p>

<p>Turning to give his attention to Granger, Matt received
another start. The young fellow was lying beside
the taxicab, lifting himself weakly on one arm. His tin
box had dropped near him, and his derby hat had fallen
off. Strands of long, yellow hair, which must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
done into a coil and hidden under a wig of some sort, had
been released and were waving about Granger’s shoulders.</p>

<p>A woman! Here was a pretty tangle, and Motor Matt
was astounded.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III_A_TWISTED_SKEIN" id="CHAPTER_III_A_TWISTED_SKEIN">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="titlefont">A TWISTED SKEIN.</span></a></h2>


<p>As though a taxicab, minus its driver and running
amuck into a stone wall, was not enough hard luck to
throw across the path of Motor Matt, he had also to deal
with a young woman masquerading in man’s attire. But
for the mishap to the taxicab, Matt would probably never
have discovered that the supposed youth was other than
“he” seemed.</p>

<p>There were a number of details that perplexed our
young friend just then, and among them&mdash;and not the
least&mdash;was the strange disappearance of the driver
of the machine. This problem, however, would have to
wait. Matt felt that the young woman should claim his
first attention.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” he asked, feeling more concern on
that point than he would have done had his companion
been of the other sex.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the girl, her face reddening with
mortification.</p>

<p>Matt started to help her up, but she regained her feet
without his aid and picked up the tin box and the hat.</p>

<p>“I suppose, Miss Granger,” said he, “that I should
have known, from the way those yellow tresses were
smoothed upward at the back of your head, that&mdash;that
you were not what you were trying to appear; but, of
course, I wasn’t looking for any such deception as this.”</p>

<p>Tears sprang to the girl’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know what you will think of me,” she
murmured. “You see, a man has so much better chance
for getting on in the world that I&mdash;I have been obliged
to play this&mdash;this rôle in&mdash;in self-defense.”</p>

<p>“You have played the rôle for some time?”</p>

<p>“For&mdash;for a year, now.”</p>

<p>“You can’t expect me to believe that, Miss Granger,”
said Matt calmly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” she flashed.</p>

<p>“Well,” he answered, “you would have cut off those
long locks if you had made a business of playing such a
part for a year. That would have been the reasonable
thing to do, and I am sure you would have done it.”</p>

<p>“Do you doubt my word?” she asked defiantly.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to doubt your word, Miss Granger, but
I have to take matters as I find them. You’re not a
messenger for Random &amp; Griggs, either, are you?”</p>

<p>She did not reply.</p>

<p>“And all this about my chum, Joe McGlory, going into
the country and wanting me to join him, isn’t true, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s true,” she declared desperately. “You’ll
have to go with me if you <a id="Ref_5"></a>want to find Mr. McGlory.”</p>

<p>“Did McGlory go into the country in a touring car with
Mr. Random?”</p>

<p>This was another question which the girl did not see
fit to answer.</p>

<p>“You’re not frank with me,” continued Matt, “and how
can you expect me to have any confidence in you? Have
you any idea what became of the driver of the taxicab?”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied.</p>

<p>“I’m going back down the road to look for him. While
I’m gone, Miss Granger, you do a little good, hard thinking.
I guess you’ll make up your mind that it’s best to
be perfectly frank with me.”</p>

<p>Without saying anything further, Matt turned away
and started back along the road. He was caught in a
twisted skein of events, and was the more perturbed
because he could not think of any possible object the girl
might have in trying to deceive him.</p>

<p>But, whatever plot was afoot, Matt was positive that
the accident to the taxicab had nothing whatever to do
with it. That had been something outside the girl’s calculations,
and an investigation might lead to results.</p>

<p>The driver had not been long off the seat of the taxicab
when the machine collided with the wall. This was self-evident,
for the machine could not have proceeded any
great distance without a controlling hand on the steering
wheel.</p>

<p>Less than a hundred feet from the spot where the accident
had happened, Matt found the driver sitting up at
the edge of some bushes by the roadside. He was covered
with dust, and was holding his hat in his hands.
There was a vacant stare in his eyes as he watched Matt
approach.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” queried Matt.</p>

<p>The driver acted as though he did not understand. He
began turning the hat around and around in his hands
and peering into the crown in the abstracted fashion of
one who is struggling with a hard mental problem.</p>

<p>A little way back, Matt remembered that they had
passed a road house. If he could get the driver to the
road house, perhaps the people there could do something
for him.</p>

<p>“Come,” said he, catching the man by the arm and
trying to lift him. “You are sick, and I’ll help you to
a place where they can look after you.”</p>

<p>Mechanically the driver put his hat on his head and
got to his feet. For a moment he stood still, staring at
Matt speculatively, as though trying to guess who he was
and where he had come from; then, suddenly, he whirled
and broke from Matt’s grasp, running farther back into
the bushes.</p>

<p>In half a dozen leaps Matt was upon him again, and
had caught him firmly by the collar.</p>

<p>“I’m a friend of yours,” he said soothingly, “and I
want to take you to a place where you can be cared for.
You’re not right in your head.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” mumbled the driver.</p>

<p>“Can’t you remember me? I was in your taxicab; you
picked me up at the Flatiron Building.”</p>

<p>“What taxicab?” the man asked, drawing one hand
across his forehead.</p>

<p>“Yours.”</p>

<p>The man’s blank look slowly yielded to a glimmering
of reason.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he muttered, “I&mdash;I remember. The young
chap hired me at Herald Square. I was to take him to
the Flatiron Building, pick up another fare, and then go
along the Pelham Road as far as Rye. I guess I’ve got
that straight.”</p>

<p>“Sure it was at Herald Square that the young fellow
hired you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m positive of it.”</p>

<p>The driver was getting back his wits by swift degrees.</p>

<p>“What was the matter with you?” asked Matt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sort of a fit. I used to have ’em a whole lot, but
this is the first that’s come on me for purty nigh six
months. No matter what I’m doin’, I jest drop an’ don’t
know a thing for a minute or two; then, after I come
out of it, I’m gen’rally a little while piecin’ things together.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t be driving a taxicab, if you’re subject
to such spells.”</p>

<p>“Thought I’d got over ’em. I won’t have another,
now, for two or three weeks, anyway. Didn’t you see
me when I tumbled from the seat?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That’s blamed queer! Didn’t you hear me, either?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“How did you find out I was gone from up front?”</p>

<p>“The taxi jumped into a stone wall,” answered Matt
dryly, “and threw us out. If you’ll step out of this patch
of brush you can see the machine.”</p>

<p>“Was it damaged much?” asked the man anxiously.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to be.”</p>

<p>“Think I can tinker it up so as to take you and that
other young chap on to Rye?”</p>

<p>“That’s where you’re to take us, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And the young fellow hired you at Herald Square?”</p>

<p>“Say, my brain’s as clear as yours, now. I know jest
what I’m sayin’. I was hired at Herald Square to take
him to the Flatiron Buildin’, and then to pick you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All right,” cut in Matt. “Do you know who the
young fellow is?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know him from Adam. Never saw him before.”</p>

<p>“After you get to Rye, what&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The drumming of a motor car, traveling swiftly, was
heard at that moment. The car was close and, through
the bushes, Matt caught a glimpse of its fleeting red body
as it plunged past.</p>

<p>Thinking that the car, which seemed to be big and
powerful, might be used for towing the taxicab&mdash;in case
it was very seriously damaged&mdash;to the nearest garage,
Matt jumped for the road.</p>

<p>By the time he had gained the road, however, the
touring car was abreast of the taxicab and forging
straight onward at a tremendous clip. Matt’s intention
of hailing the machine was lost in a spasm of astonishment
the moment he had caught sight of the single passenger
in the tonneau. There was one man in front with
the driver, but the passenger in the tonneau&mdash;there could
be no doubt about it&mdash;was Joe McGlory!</p>

<p>By the time Matt had recovered full possession of his
senses, the touring car was out of sight.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV_MOTOR_MATTS_DUTY" id="CHAPTER_IV_MOTOR_MATTS_DUTY">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="titlefont">MOTOR MATT’S DUTY.</span></a></h2>


<p>For Matt, in this queer taxicab tangle, one mystery
was piling upon another. Joe McGlory, in a faster car
than the “taxi,” had left New York after Matt and the
girl had taken their departure. Joe might be with Mr.
Random, but the girl had certainly made a misstatement
when she said that the cowboy and the broker had hurried
off in advance of the taxicab. But then, the girl
had made many misstatements.</p>

<p>By the narrow margin of no more than thirty seconds,
Matt had failed to reach the road in time to hail the
touring car. Fate works with trifles, drawing her thread
fine from the insignificant affairs of life.</p>

<p>The driver came unsteadily through the bushes and
stood at Matt’s side, gazing toward the taxicab.</p>

<p>“What was you intendin’ to do?” he asked of Matt.</p>

<p>“I was thinking we could hail that automobile and, if
the taxicab was too badly injured to proceed under its
own power, we could have the machine towed to the
nearest garage.”</p>

<p>“We won’t have any trouble findin’ a car to tow us&mdash;if
we have to. If the machine ain’t too badly smashed, I’m
goin’ to take you on to Rye.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’d better do the driving,” suggested Matt.</p>

<p>“Bosh! I’m all right for two or three weeks. The
spells ain’t bad, but they’re mighty inconvenient.”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” exclaimed Matt. “That other passenger
and myself might have been killed.”</p>

<p>“You wasn’t either of you hurt, was you?”</p>

<p>That was the first remark the driver had made that
showed any solicitude for his passengers.</p>

<p>“No,” Matt answered. “Let’s get back and see if we
can repair the taxi.”</p>

<p>When they reached the taxicab, the girl was sitting on
a stone near the machine. Her long tresses had been
replaced under the derby hat, and she looked sufficiently
boyish to keep up the deception&mdash;so far as the driver was
concerned. Matt passed her with hardly a glance, and
helped the driver make his investigation.</p>

<p>No serious damage had been done to the taxicab. A
lamp was smashed, and some of the electric terminals
had been jarred from their posts, but not a tire had been
punctured, and the machine seemed as capable as ever of
taking the road.</p>

<p>If the girl was curious as to the sudden disappearance
and reappearance of the driver, she kept her curiosity to
herself. When the driver had backed the machine into
the road and headed it eastward, Matt turned to the girl.</p>

<p>“Rye is the place we are bound for?” he said tentatively.</p>

<p>She gave him a quick, troubled glance.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered.</p>

<p>Probably she was wondering whether he was intending
to keep on with the journey.</p>

<p>“Then,” proceeded Matt, “let’s get inside. We’ve lost
a good deal of time.”</p>

<p>He held the door open and the girl got into the vehicle.
He followed her, after telling the driver to make his best
speed.</p>

<p>“The driver had some sort of a fit,” Matt explained,
when they were once more under way, “and fell off the
seat. You didn’t see him when he dropped, did you?”</p>

<p>“If I had,” she answered, somewhat tartly, “I should
have spoken about it.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” returned Matt calmly. “So many peculiar
things are happening, though, that I wasn’t sure but the
disappearance of the driver might have had something to
do with your plans.”</p>

<p>“<em>My</em> plans?” she echoed.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whose plans they are, but I suppose, if
some one else laid them, you are pretty well informed or
you couldn’t carry them out. What are we to do when
we get to Rye?”</p>

<p>“There will be another automobile there&mdash;a fast car&mdash;waiting
to take us on along the Boston Post Road.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“How far?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere between Loon Lake and Stoughton, on
the Boston Pike.”</p>

<p>Again Matt was astounded.</p>

<p>“That’s pretty close to Boston, isn’t it?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“It’s a good deal closer to Boston than it is to New
York.”</p>

<p>“When do you think we’ll get to&mdash;to where we’re
going?”</p>

<p>“Some time to-night,” was the careless response.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to realize,” said Matt, just the barest
riffle of temper showing itself, “that I hadn’t any intention
of taking such a long ride as this when I left the
Flatiron Building.”</p>

<p>“Your friend wants you,” said the girl. “If that’s not
enough to keep you on the long ride, then you can get out
at Mamaroneck&mdash;we’ve already passed New Rochelle&mdash;and
take the train back to New York.”</p>

<p>The girl’s indifferent manner puzzled him. She must
have seen the touring car pass the taxicab, and she must
have known that Joe McGlory was in the car. What this
had to do with her present attitude, if anything, Matt
could not guess. For all that, he felt positive she did not
think he had seen the touring car dash along the road
with McGlory.</p>

<p>“You told me McGlory had left New York ahead of
us,” said he.</p>

<p>“That’s what I was told.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, he didn’t leave until after we did,
for he passed us while I was looking for the missing
driver.”</p>

<p>She shot a quick look at him.</p>

<p>“You saw that, did you?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you stop the car and find out what
Mr. McGlory wanted?”</p>

<p>“The car was going too fast. Besides, I didn’t know
my friend was in the car until it was too far away.”</p>

<p>She laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Then you <em>do</em> have a little confidence in me, after all?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” answered Matt, with a little laugh. “For
reasons of your own, I believe you’re going to take
me to the place where some one else is taking McGlory.
I don’t know why, but I suppose I’ll find out if I wait
long enough. Anyway, if Joe McGlory is in any sort of
trouble, my place is at his side. And if you try to get
away from me before I find McGlory,” he threatened,
“I shall turn you over to the police in one of these small
towns we’re passing through.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t do that without a legal excuse.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I a legal excuse? You got me away from
New York by telling me something that wasn’t true.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know, yet, that what I told you isn’t true.
I don’t think you could have me arrested for something
that hasn’t happened.”</p>

<p>Some desperate purpose was urging the girl on. What
it was, and why it should be desperate, were beyond
Matt’s comprehension.</p>

<p>“You’re a young man with a mission,” said the girl,
turning a pair of frosty blue eyes upon the young fellow
beside her, “and the mission is to get to where we’re
going, and find Mr. McGlory. You’ll be a whole lot
wiser after that.”</p>

<p>Matt, in his own mind, did not doubt this statement.
But that reflection in no wise helped him just then.</p>

<p>Presently the girl began peering through the window
in the top of the door, watching the roadside as they
scurried along.</p>

<p>“What are you looking for, Miss Granger?” asked
Matt, after the girl had been peering steadily through
the glass for several minutes.</p>

<p>“For the other car,” she answered, without looking
around.</p>

<p>“You said that was to be waiting for us at Rye.”</p>

<p>“It may have come this way to meet us, and&mdash;&mdash;Ah,
stop!” she cried, lifting her voice. “We’ll get out here,
driver.”</p>

<p>The driver was a surprised man as he brought the
taxicab to a halt. It was a lonely piece of road where
they had come to a stop, shadowed deeply, as it was, by a
thick growth of trees on either side.</p>

<p>“It’s a mile, yet, before we get to the town,” demurred
the driver.</p>

<p>“We’ll stop here,” said the girl decisively.</p>

<p>“I can’t see the other car,” spoke up Matt, looking in
vain for the automobile that was to take them on.</p>

<p>Although he did not see another car, yet his eye was
caught and held by something white fluttering from a
bush. While the girl was settling with the driver, Matt
made his way to the roadside and examined the fluttering
object. It was a white cloth, and had evidently been tied
to the bush as a signal.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” shouted Matt, as the driver was
climbing back into his seat.</p>

<p>Both the driver and the girl whirled around and stared
in his direction.</p>

<p>“I may want to go back to New York in the taxicab,”
continued Matt. “I’d like to talk with you a minute, Mr.
Granger,” he added, putting a little emphasis on the
“mister.”</p>

<p>The girl advanced slowly toward him.</p>

<p>“Go back, if you’re afraid to go on and do what your
friend wants you to do,” said she.</p>

<p>“I’m not at all certain,” said Matt, “that I’m doing
what my friend wants me to do. The only reason I’m
keeping on with you is because I saw McGlory pass me
in that red touring car. I’d like to ask you, Miss Granger,
if you stopped because you saw this signal,” and
Matt turned and pointed to the white cloth.</p>

<p>“That’s the reason I stopped, Motor Matt,” the girl
replied promptly.</p>

<p>“The plans you are following seem to have been laid
with a good deal of care, and to point to something that
may prove pretty serious. I think, Miss Granger, that
you and I will go on to Rye, and stop there.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to stop at Rye,” answered the girl, with
spirit.</p>

<p>“I think you will,” answered Matt coolly. “On second
thought, I believe it’s my duty to turn you over to the
authorities until I can find out something more about my
chum. You can explain to the judge why you’re disguised
as you are.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that!” gasped the girl, starting back.</p>

<p>“I do,” declared Matt. “As I said, I believe it’s my
duty, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At that precise juncture, something descended over
Matt’s head, thrown from behind. It might have been a
shawl, or an automobile coat, or a piece of cloth&mdash;there
was no time to take particular note of it. The attack came
so suddenly, and so unexpectedly, that he was not able
to defend himself.</p>

<p>With his face smothered in the thick folds, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
drawn roughly backward. A foot tripped him, and he
measured his length on the ground. The next moment
he was seized by strong hands and dragged through the
bushes and into the woods. He struggled blindly and
fiercely against his unseen captors, but they were too
many of them. He was powerless to free himself, and
the smothering cloth that covered his head and shoulders
made it impossible for him to call for help.</p>

<span class="titlefont">HOW MCGLORY WAS FOOLED.</span></a></h2>


<p>McGlory found his way to the address in Liberty Street
without any difficulty. But he was too early. The Stock
Exchange had not yet opened, and only a few clerks were
at work in the brokerage offices of Random &amp; Griggs.</p>

<p>The cowboy sat down in a room where there were a
number of chairs facing a big blackboard. There were
a stepladder and a chair in front of the blackboard, and
off to one side was a machine in a glass case with a high
basket standing under it. A ribbon of paper hung from
the machine into the basket. This, of course, was the
“ticker” which received and recorded the quotations of
stocks at the Exchange, but it was not yet time for it to
begin work.</p>

<p>McGlory and Matt were at least an hour too early in
setting about their morning’s business.</p>

<p>While the cowboy sat in his chair in front of the blackboard,
wondering how long he could wait for Random
or Griggs and yet be at the Flatiron Building as per appointment
with Matt, a man sauntered in, looked at an
office boy who was just going out with an armful of
ticker tape, and then approached McGlory.</p>

<p>He was the gentleman in the noisy apparel&mdash;he of the
cigar, and the newspaper, and the listening ear and
scheming brain. He was playing boldly, for the stakes
were worth the risk.</p>

<p>“Young man,” said he to McGlory, “are you waiting
for some one?”</p>

<p>“I’m waiting for one of the big high boys that boss the
layout,” answered McGlory.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” The man flashed a quick look around and
made sure that only he and McGlory were in the room.
“Well,” he went on, “I am Mr. Random.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” exclaimed the cowboy, getting up. “I’m Joe
McGlory, from the land of sun, sand, solitude, and pay-streaks.
I’ve run in here to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>McGlory got no further. Random grabbed his hand
effusively.</p>

<p>“We’ve been expecting you,” said he. “We have a
meeting of the syndicate on Wednesday evening, and a
letter from the colonel gives your name and informs us
that you will be on deck with the bullion from the test
run of the mill. If the gold shows up properly, there’s
no doubt about our people coming across with the money.
But we can’t talk here&mdash;some one is liable to drop in on
us at any moment. This business is private, very private.
Come with me, Mr. McGlory, and I’ll find a place where
we can have a little star-chamber session.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to tear you away from business,” protested
McGlory.</p>

<p>Random waved his hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“Griggs will look after the office,” said he. “This ‘Pauper’s
Dream’ matter is a big deal to swing, and I guess
it’s worth a few hours of my time. This way.”</p>

<p>Random walked out into Liberty Street, rounded a
corner, entered a door, passed through a barroom, and
finally piloted the cowboy into a small apartment, furnished
with two chairs, a table, and an electric fan.</p>

<p>After he and McGlory had seated themselves, Random
pushed an electric button. A waiter appeared.</p>

<p>“What are you drinking, Mr. McGlory?” inquired Random.
“I can recommend their Scotch highballs, and as
for cocktails, they put up a dry Martini here that goes
down like oil, and stirs you up like a torchlight procession.”</p>

<p>“Elegant!” cackled McGlory. “I reckon, neighbor,”
and he cocked up his eye at the waiter, “that I’ll trouble
you for a seltzer lemonade, mixed with a pickled cherry
and the cross-section of a ripe orange.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that you’re from Arizona, and
don’t irrigate!” gasped Random.</p>

<p>“We irrigate with water, and that’s always been good
enough for your Uncle Joseph. Besides, I’m training
with Motor Matt, and our work calls for a clear brain
and a steady hand. Seltzer lemonade for mine.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have a cigar?”</p>

<p>“That’s another thing I miss in the high jump.”</p>

<p>“Give me the same as usual, Jack,” said Random, to the
waiter. “You’re a lad of high principles, I see,” remarked
the broker, when the waiter had retired.</p>

<p>“It’s a matter of business, rather than of principle.
Whenever an <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hombre</i> gets his trouble appetite worked up,
the first thing he does is to take on a cargo of red-eye.
That points him straight for fireworks and fatalities.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but you’re right,” said Random reflectively.</p>

<p>The waiter returned, and Random mixed himself something
while McGlory fished around in his lemonade for
the “pickled” cherry. Over their glasses they talked at
some length, the broker seeking information about the
section of Arizona where the colonel had begun operations
on the “Pauper’s Dream.”</p>

<p>“What time is it, Mr. Random?” asked McGlory, in
the midst of their talk.</p>

<p>“Just ten,” replied Random, with a look at his watch.</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ schedules!” cried the cowboy, starting up.
“I’m to meet Pard Matt at ten, at the Flatiron Building.
On my way there, I’ve got to drop in at the bank.”</p>

<p>“Why are you to call at the bank?” asked Random.</p>

<p>“To find out whether the bullion has got here, and to
show them my order for it from the colonel.”</p>

<p>“You have the order with you?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. Just got it this morning.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be necessary for you to go to the bank, Mr.
McGlory,” said Random. “I’ve been there, myself, and
I know the bullion has arrived. As for showing the
order, you won’t have to do that until you take out the
gold, on Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be a good scheme to get acquainted with
the bank men?”</p>

<p>“Not at all! If they doubt your authority to receive
the bullion, in spite of the colonel’s order, a word from
me will make everything all right. I believe I will go
with you to the Flatiron Building. I’ve heard of this
Motor Matt, and should like to meet him.”</p>

<p>McGlory wondered a little at the cheerful way in which
Random left Griggs to look after the brokerage business;
at the same time, the cowboy felt not a little flattered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
have Random neglect his personal affairs for the purpose
of meeting Matt.</p>

<p>A cab carried them to the Flatiron Building, and Random
waited on the walk while McGlory went bushwhacking
for Matt. But Matt wasn’t in evidence.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he got tired waiting for you,” suggested Random,
“and went away?”</p>

<p>“Nary, he wouldn’t,” returned the puzzled McGlory, “I
reckon he’s talking with an aviator, upstairs, and has lost
track of the time. I’ll go find Lafitte, and, ten to one, my
pard will be with him. Wait here for a brace of shakes,
Mr. Random, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Just then a man pushed forward from the entrance to
the cigar store. The man wore a cap and gloves, and
looked like a chauffeur.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said he, addressing McGlory, “but
are you Motor Matt’s chum?”</p>

<p>“That’s me,” answered the cowboy.</p>

<p>“McGlory’s your name, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Joe McGlory, that’s the label.”</p>

<p>“Well, Motor Matt had a hurry-up call into the country.
It’s a long ride, and he went by automobile. He
wants you to follow him, and he hired me to wait for you
and then take you after him. That’s my chug cart,” and
the man pointed to a red touring car at the curb.</p>

<p>“Speak to me about this!” cried McGlory. “What’s to
pay? Do you know?”</p>

<p>“Motor Matt didn’t say. All he wanted was for me to
follow him with you in my car.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet a bushel of Mexican dollars it has something
to do with Lafitte,” hazarded the cowboy. “Of course,
I’ll go. Mr. Random,” and he turned to the broker, “I’m
sorry you couldn’t meet up with my pard, but I’ll bring
him around to your office Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“Just a minute, Mr. McGlory,” and the broker took the
cowboy’s hand and drew him to one side. “I don’t like
the looks of this thing,” he went on, in a low tone.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked McGlory, surprised.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I’ve got a presentiment that something’s
wrong.”</p>

<p>“There’s something unexpected happened to Pard
Matt,” said McGlory, “or he wouldn’t have piked off like
this. But his orders are clear enough. I’m to follow
him, so it’s me for the country.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” and Random wrinkled his brows, “this has
something to do with the ‘Pauper’s Dream.’”</p>

<p>McGlory laughed incredulously.</p>

<p>“I can’t see how,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Neither can I, but it’s possible, all the same. We’re
to get a good fat commission for placing that property,
and I don’t intend to let the commission slip through my
fingers.”</p>

<p>“It’s a cinch, Mr. Random, that you’re barking up the
wrong tree. This business of Matt’s has more to do with
flying machines than with mines, and I’ll bet my moccasins
on it.”</p>

<p>“If you haven’t any objections, Mr. McGlory, I’d like
to ride with you and make sure.”</p>

<p>“The shuffer says it’s a long trip.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care how long it is, just so I can assure myself
that nothing is going crossways with the ‘Pauper’s
Dream.’”</p>

<p>“All right, neighbor. If that’s how you feel about it,
you’re welcome to one corner of the bubble-wagon.”</p>

<p>The three of them climbed into the touring car, Random
in front with the driver, and McGlory in the tonneau.
As soon as they were seated, the car began working
its way through the crowded streets toward a section
less congested with traffic. As the way cleared, the speed
increased. Once on the Pelham Road, the chauffeur
“hit ’er up,” and the red car devoured the miles in a way
that brought joy to McGlory’s soul.</p>

<p>When they passed a taxicab, with its nose rammed into
a stone fence, the chauffeur remarked that the taxi was
a good ways from home. Mr. Random looked thoughtful,
but he made no request that the red car slacken its
speed. McGlory saw a young fellow sitting on a bowlder,
but the spectacle afforded by the taxicab and the supposed
youth meant nothing to him. His mind was circling
about Motor Matt.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI_ON_THE_BOSTON_PIKE" id="CHAPTER_VI_ON_THE_BOSTON_PIKE">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="titlefont">ON THE BOSTON PIKE.</span></a></h2>


<p>Motor Matt, helpless and half stifled among the bushes,
felt lashings being put on his arms and legs; then, while
some one laid a hand on the cloth and pressed it tightly
over his lips, a bit of conversation was wafted to him
from the road. Because of the smothering cloth, the
voices seemed to come from a great distance, although
the spoken words were distinct enough.</p>

<p>“What’re you tryin’ to do with that chap?”</p>

<p>This was the driver of the taxicab. His curiosity, as
was quite natural, had been aroused by the treacherous
attack on Matt.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, my friend,” replied a voice&mdash;a voice
Matt had not heard before.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s all right, but it looks mighty crooked to
me. Two of you threw a cloth over that chap’s head,
downed him, an’ dragged him into the brush. I got a
warm notion of goin’ on to Rye and gettin’ a constable.”</p>

<p>The other man laughed.</p>

<p>“You’d be making a fool of yourself, if you did. I’m
from Matteawan, and the young fellow is an escaped
lunatic. He’s a desperate chap to deal with, and we had
to take him by surprise in order to capture him.”</p>

<p>A long whistle followed those words.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Say, he didn’t look like he was dippy.”</p>

<p>“Some of ’em never look the part&mdash;until they find
you’re after ’em.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you nab him in New York, instead o’
bringin’ him ’way out here?”</p>

<p>“He’s armed, and he’d have put up a fight. In a
crowded street, some one would have been hurt. It was
better to lure him off here, into the country.”</p>

<p>“I guess you know your business. Who’s the other
young chap?”</p>

<p>“He’s the lunatic’s brother.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t say anything about this, driver. The
family wouldn’t like to have it known. You’ve been put
to a little extra trouble, and here’s a ten to make up for
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s han’some, an’ I’m obliged to you.”</p>

<p>It can be imagined, perhaps, what Matt’s feelings were
as he listened to this. He tried frantically to burst the
cords that secured his arms, but the tying had been too
securely done. He made an attempt, too, to call out and
inform the driver of the taxicab that the tale he was listening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to was false, but the hand over his face pressed the
cloth more firmly down upon his lips.</p>

<p>Resigning himself to the situation, Matt listened while
the purr of a motor came to his ears and died away in
the direction of New York. A friend who might have
saved him was gone, and Matt was completely at the
mercy of his captors.</p>

<p>Some one came through the bushes; there were two of
them, it seemed, and they talked as they approached.</p>

<p>“I was up in the air when I heard Motor Matt say he
was to stop at Rye,” said the voice that had talked with
the taxi driver. “What was the matter, Pearl?”</p>

<p>It was the girl who answered, and she told briefly how
the driver had fallen from the seat of the taxicab, how
Matt had discovered her disguise, and how his suspicions
had been aroused.</p>

<p>“I was up in the air myself, dad,” finished the girl,
drawing a deep breath of relief. “But we’re all right,
now. The way you pulled the wool over the eyes of that
taxicab man was splendid.”</p>

<p>“Doing the right thing at the right time, Pearl, is your
father’s long suit. Where were you when Tibbits went
past in the red car?”</p>

<p>“Sitting on a stone at the roadside.”</p>

<p>“Where was Motor Matt?”</p>

<p>“Back along the road in the brush, looking for the
driver.”</p>

<p>“And those in the red car never saw him!”</p>

<p>“No, but he saw them and recognized McGlory.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, this is our day for luck, and no mistake.
Watch the road, Pearl, while we’re getting out our own
car. We don’t want to be seen lifting a bound man
into it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll watch,” the girl answered.</p>

<p>Matt was still further impressed with the comprehensive
nature of the plans launched against him and
McGlory. Three motor cars had been used in the game,
and there must be at least four men in the plot besides
the girl. But what was the purpose of the plotters?
What end were they seeking to gain by all this high-handed,
criminal work?</p>

<p>From off to the left Matt could hear the pounding of
a motor as it took up its cycle. After the engine had
settled into a steady hum, the crunching of the bushes
indicated that a heavy car was being forced through them
into the road.</p>

<p>“All right, Dimmock!” called a voice.</p>

<p>“Is the road clear, Sanders?” answered Dimmock.</p>

<p>“There’s not a soul in sight.”</p>

<p>“Then come here and help me. We’ll take this coat
from Motor Matt’s head and replace it with a gag&mdash;a
twisted handkerchief will do. The quicker we can get
him into the car, now, the better.”</p>

<p>The next moment the smothering cloth was jerked
from Matt’s head and shoulders. He had just time to
gulp down a deep breath of air when the twisted handkerchief
was forced between his teeth and knotted in
place.</p>

<p>He saw a slender, wiry man, soberly but richly dressed,
and another, short, thick-set, and wearing a long dust
coat and cap.</p>

<p>“Take him by the feet, Sanders,” said the slender man,
who, from this, Matt knew to be Dimmock.</p>

<p>Between them Matt was lifted, carried out to the road,
and shoved into the tonneau of a touring car, while the
girl held the door open. There was a top to the car, and
Matt was made to sit on the floor and lean back against
the seat.</p>

<p>By every means in his power Matt tried to let his captors
know that he wanted to talk with them, but they
either could not understand him, or else had no intention
of letting him relieve his mind. The girl and Dimmock
seated themselves on either side of Matt, and the same
coat that had been used in effecting Matt’s capture was
dropped over him.</p>

<p>In this manner the strange party started away along the
road, the prisoner unable to see anything of the route
they were taking.</p>

<p>Matt was sensible of the swiftness of their flight, and
of the driver’s perfect mastery of the machine. The explosion
in the cylinders was unfailing, the mixture of air
and gasoline was perfect, and the coils hummed their
beautiful rhythm to the well-timed spark.</p>

<p>Gradually there was forming, in Matt’s mind, an idea
that these desperate plotters had made some huge mistake.
He could not account, in any other way, for the
execution of such a plan as they were carrying out.</p>

<p>He and McGlory were not being kidnapped to be held
for ransom. Such an idea was preposterous. Matt had
no relatives, so far as he knew, rich or poor; and neither
had McGlory.</p>

<p>Yes, Matt was sure that Dimmock, and his daughter,
and Tibbits, the man who had dashed past with McGlory
in the red car, were blundering in some way. At the end
of the journey, wherever that might be, the mistake must
be discovered, and the motor boys would be released.</p>

<p>The point that troubled Matt a little was the fact that
his cowboy pard was not a prisoner. He appeared to be
traveling in the red car of his own free will. Was that
because he had been lured away, and had not yet had his
suspicions aroused?</p>

<p>There was little talk between Dimmock and his daughter,
and Sanders was attending strictly to his driving.
Now and then, however, a word was dropped as the car
slowed down which gave Matt an inkling as to the course
they were taking.</p>

<p>“Stamford,” and “Bridgeport” were on the line of their
flight, and this proved conclusively that they were proceeding
in the direction of Boston.</p>

<p>The day was warm, and Matt, crouched uncomfortably
under the coat, was having anything but an enjoyable
ride. By twisting about, however, he managed to give
some relief to his cramped limbs.</p>

<p>Hour after hour the car swept on. Once they halted
at a filling station to replenish their supply of gasoline,
but the man in charge of the supply tank was kept
adroitly in ignorance of the fact that there was a prisoner
in the tonneau.</p>

<p>By degrees a numbness crept along Matt’s limbs, and
a drowsiness enwrapped his brain. He slept, in spite of
his many discomforts, and was awakened, finally, by a
rattle from somewhere forward of the tonneau.</p>

<p>The car was at a stop.</p>

<p>“What was the trouble, Sanders?” called the voice of
Dimmock.</p>

<p>“Nothing much,” answered Sanders. “It’s fixed now.”</p>

<p>“Why not let Motor Matt sit up here on the seat between
us?” suggested the girl. “It’s so dark no one
could see him&mdash;even if we happened to be passed by another
car.”</p>

<p>“We might as well give him a little comfort, I suppose,”
answered Dimmock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon the coat was pulled away, and Matt found
that it was night. Dimmock reached down and helped
him up on the seat.</p>

<p>“We’re doing this for your comfort, Motor Matt,” said
Dimmock. “I hope you’ll appreciate it, and not try to
make any trouble for us.”</p>

<p>Matt moved his cramped joints and stretched his legs
the full width of the tonneau. There were shadowy
bluffs on each side of the road, and a tracery of boughs
lay against the lighter background of sky. From the
fragrant odor, Matt gathered that they were in the depths
of a pine forest. He gurgled ineffectively behind the
gag.</p>

<p>“He wants to talk, dad,” said the girl. “Why not let
him? If any one comes you can prevent him from calling
out.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got too much heart, girl, for this kind of
work,” returned Dimmock. Nevertheless, he fumbled
with the knots at the back of Matt’s head, and removed
the handkerchief.</p>

<span class="titlefont">THE JOURNEY’S END.</span></a></h2>


<p>Matt inhaled deep breaths of the pine-scented air. The
ozone held tonic properties and freshened him wonderfully.</p>

<p>“It’s been a long time since I had breakfast, Mr. Dimmock,”
were his first words.</p>

<p>“You’ve skipped dinner,” returned Dimmock, evidently
pleased to note that the prisoner was taking recent
events in such a matter-of-fact way, “but you’ll have
a fine supper to make up for it. In less than an hour
from now we’ll be where we’re going.”</p>

<p>Sanders cranked up, climbed into his seat, and the car
moved on through the forest aisle, the searchlights boring
bright holes in the dark.</p>

<p>“Where is the journey’s end to be?” inquired Matt.</p>

<p>“Somewhere between Loon Lake and Stoughton.
That’s all you’re to know.”</p>

<p>“This is the Boston Pike?”</p>

<p>“We’ve been traveling the Boston Pike for a long time&mdash;but
I guess that knowledge won’t help you much if
you ever wanted to find the house again.”</p>

<p>“We’re about due at Matteawan, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>Dimmock laughed at that, and the laugh was echoed
by the girl.</p>

<p>“I had to tell the taxicab driver something,” said Dimmock.</p>

<p>“This is quite a plot you’re working out,” pursued
Matt.</p>

<p>“It was rather hastily evolved by Tibbits, but it seems
to be doing the work.”</p>

<p>“Tibbits, if I’ve got it right, is the man with McGlory?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got it right.”</p>

<p>“Did you bring my chum from Liberty Street?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Motor Matt, I hadn’t anything to do with
that part of it. Pearl and Sanders and I were to look
after you.”</p>

<p>“How did you happen to be hidden away on the Boston
Post Road?”</p>

<p>“We thought that was safer than to meet you at Rye.”</p>

<p>Dimmock had a complaisant air&mdash;entirely the air of a
man whose plans are succeeding, and with ultimate victory
assured.</p>

<p>“What was the use of all this juggling with taxicabs
and touring cars?” continued Matt.</p>

<p>He was groping for information, in order to lead up
to the announcement that Tibbits, Dimmock, and the rest
were having their trouble for their pains.</p>

<p>“You see,” explained Dimmock, “it was easier for
Pearl to work alone, and pretend to be a messenger for
the brokers. If Sanders and I had been along, you’d
have suspected something.”</p>

<p>“I suspected something, anyhow, and if you hadn’t resorted
to violence, back there on the road, your daughter
would have been held in the Rye police station until I
could have learned more about what was going on.”</p>

<p>“Which shows our wisdom in waiting for you on the
other side of Rye,” commented Dimmock.</p>

<p>“What’s back of all this, Dimmock?” demanded Matt.</p>

<p>“You’ll find that out later,” was the reply. “Tibbits
is at the head of this little conspiracy, and most of the
talking must be left for him.”</p>

<p>“How did you know I was to meet my chum at the
Flatiron Building at ten o’clock?”</p>

<p>“That’s something else you’ll have to learn from Tibbits.”</p>

<p>“Do you know how Tibbits got McGlory to take his
ride into the country?”</p>

<p>“Just as we got you, if the business worked out according
to plan. You were told that your chum wanted
you, and McGlory was told that you wanted him. That
seemed to be enough,” and Dimmock laughed under his
breath.</p>

<p>“There’s been a mistake, Dimmock,” said Matt earnestly.</p>

<p>“Not on our side,” answered Dimmock.</p>

<p>“Ever since ten o’clock this morning you and your pals
have played fast and loose with the law, and you’re under
a delusion of some sort.”</p>

<p>“You’re the one who is under a delusion.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’ll find out differently. I feel so sure of
that, that I’m perfectly willing to go with you to the end
of the journey. The facts will come out, at that time.”</p>

<p>“They will,” said Dimmock, with emphasis.</p>

<p>“My mission is to find my chum&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ll have fulfilled your mission when we get to
where we’re going.”</p>

<p>“McGlory will be there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That’s all I can ask. Take these ropes off me, can’t
you? I’m too anxious to find McGlory to try to get
away.”</p>

<p>“The ropes won’t be removed until we reach the
house.”</p>

<p>“What’s to be done at the house?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to your physical harm. You and McGlory
will be entertained there for a few days. You’ll be able
to eat, drink, and enjoy yourselves&mdash;within certain prescribed
limits.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t do that!” cried Matt, suddenly remembering
that his chum had to be back in New York by
Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to stay at the house,” was the decided
answer.</p>

<p>“Why? What’s the reason?”</p>

<p>“I have talked all I’m going to about the whys and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
wherefores. Whatever else you learn you’ll have to get
from Tibbits.”</p>

<p>Matt relapsed into silence, while the car continued to
speed along the gloomy, tree-bordered road, following
the long shafts of light like a phantom locomotive on
gleaming rails.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a lessening of the speed, a swerve
to the right, a quick stop, and the touring car was nosing
a big iron gate, hung between square brick pillars.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said Sanders.</p>

<p>“See if the gates are locked, Sanders,” ordered Dimmock.
“They shouldn’t be. Tibbits said he would leave
them unfastened.”</p>

<p>Matt leaned forward to watch the glow from the
searchlights as it played over the massive iron work,
penetrated the heavy bars, and lost itself in a dense mass
of trees and shrubbery beyond.</p>

<p>The gates were not fastened, and Sanders pushed them
wide. After running the car into the yard, the driver
left it standing on a graveled drive while he returned to
close the gates, and lock them.</p>

<p>“What sort of a place is this, Dimmock?” asked Matt,
peering around, but seeing little, except the heavy shadows
cast by trees and bushes.</p>

<p>“It’s a fine old place,” replied Dimmock, “and you and
your chum should feel highly flattered at being entertained
here. The family, as it fortunately happens for
Tibbits and the rest of us, are in Europe this summer.”</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t any right here?”</p>

<p>“We have borrowed the use of the house. Tibbits has
the run of the place, and we’re here by his invitation.”</p>

<p>Sanders got back and started the car slowly. The gravel
road wound through the trees, and finally the searchlights
flashed out upon the front of a large mansion.
The great house was silhouetted against the sky, and the
car lights swept the front door as the machine turned and
halted at the broad front steps.</p>

<p>A glow appeared suddenly in the fanlight over the
door. Sanders gave three quick, sharp blasts of the horn.
This seemed to be a signal, for the door opened as if by
magic, and a man showed darkly in the entrance.</p>

<p>“That you, Dimmock?” called the man.</p>

<p>“Who else could it be, Tibbits?” answered Dimmock.
“Did you get here safely with McGlory?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And you? Have you got Motor Matt?”</p>

<p>“We have.”</p>

<p>An exclamation of satisfaction fell from Tibbits’ lips.</p>

<p>“I was afraid Pearl had had trouble,” said he. “We
passed her on the road, sitting beside a taxicab that had
run head-on into a stone wall. Motor Matt was nowhere
in sight, and I thought he had suspected that something
was wrong, and had escaped. I didn’t dare stop and ask
any questions, you see, because McGlory was with us.”</p>

<p>“We came near having a streak of hard luck there,
Tibbits, but we pulled through all right. What shall we
do with Motor Matt?”</p>

<p>“Bring him in, of course. His chum’s anxious to see
him, and I suppose he’s equally anxious to see McGlory.”</p>

<p>“He’s tied,” said Dimmock.</p>

<p>“Then untie him. He won’t get away.”</p>

<p>Tibbits pulled something from his pocket that flashed
in the lamplight.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep him under the point of this,” Tibbits went
on, “until he gets where I want him to go.”</p>

<p>Sanders, standing on the footboard of the car, leaned
into the tonneau and helped Dimmock remove the cords
that bound Matt’s arms and legs. When the cords were
removed, Matt tried to stand, but tottered back upon the
seat.</p>

<p>“Pretty rough treatment you’ve had, eh?” laughed
Dimmock. “Well, you’ll be entertained so royally here,
Motor Matt, that you’ll forget all the unpleasant things
that have happened to you.”</p>

<p>In a few moments, Matt was able to climb out of the
tonneau. Tibbits’ revolver was leveled at him the instant
he dropped down from the footboards.</p>

<p>“Walk straight up the steps, Motor Matt,” ordered
Tibbits, “and on into the house. I’ll follow and tell you
which way to go. Be nice about it, and nothing will
happen.”</p>

<p>Matt mounted the steps. Tibbits backed to one side,
to let him pass, and the hall light shone over his face.
Matt looked at him sharply. The man was a stranger,
and he was positive he had never seen him before. This
was another fact to clinch Matt’s theory that Tibbits and
his pals were making a mistake.</p>

<p>Up the steps, through the great doors, and into a
richly furnished hall Matt passed, Tibbits, still with the
revolver aimed, following him closely.</p>

<p>“Keep straight on along the hall,” ordered Tibbits.</p>

<p>Matt kept on. The musty, close odor of a house, long
shut up, assailed his nostrils, and offered proof that Dimmock
had told the truth when he asserted that the family
were in Europe.</p>

<p>“That door on the right,” said Tibbits. “Go in there.”</p>

<p>Matt opened the door. As he closed it behind him he
heard the rasp of a key in the lock, and the “click” of a
thrown bolt.</p>

<p>“Pard!” came an overjoyed yell.</p>

<p>The next moment Matt was caught and given a bear’s
hug.</p>

<p>“Joe!” exclaimed the delighted Matt.</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s Joe,” whooped the cowboy. “What’s going
on here, anyhow? What do you want me for?”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII_CHUMS_IN_COUNCIL" id="CHAPTER_VIII_CHUMS_IN_COUNCIL">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="titlefont">CHUMS IN COUNCIL.</span></a></h2>


<p>McGlory was under the impression that Matt had sent
for him. In spite of the strange proceedings through
which the cowboy had passed, he still believed that Tibbits
had brought him on that long ride according to the
wishes of his friend. Even the locking of the door, after
Matt had entered the room, did not appear to have
aroused any suspicions in McGlory’s mind.</p>

<p>Matt looked around. He was in a large room, lined
with bookcases. At one end of the apartment was a
magnificent fireplace. A thick carpet, that gave one the
impression of walking on down, covered the floor. White
busts looked out from niches in the wall, and comfortable
chairs were scattered around. A light, suspended
from the ceiling, cast a warm glow over the room, and
over a table, heaped with food, and set with places for
two.</p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting here for an hour,” grumbled McGlory.
“Where have you been, pard, and what sort of a
layout is this that you’ve brought me into?”</p>

<p>Matt removed his hat and threw it upon a couch; then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
seating himself in a chair, he began rubbing his hands
and arms and staring at his chum.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble with you, pard?” asked McGlory.
“You act as though you were in a trance.”</p>

<p>“I am,” returned Matt. “I’m hardly able to credit my
senses. In the first place, Joe, I never sent for you and
asked you to come here.”</p>

<p>The cowboy gave a jump.</p>

<p>“Why, the driver of that red car told me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I guess he told you what some one else told me. I
was informed that you had come into the country with
Mr. Random, of Random &amp; Griggs, and that you
wanted me to follow you. That’s why I’m here.”</p>

<p>McGlory slumped into a chair, and brushed a hand
across his forehead.</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ brain twisters!” he muttered. “I came out
here to find you, and you came out here to find me!”</p>

<p>“And here we are,” laughed Matt.</p>

<p>“And what are we here for?” gasped McGlory.</p>

<p>“Give it up. But I think somebody has made a big
mistake, and that they’re going to find it out before
they’re many hours older. If that’s our supper on the
table, suppose we get busy with it. I haven’t had anything
to eat since morning.”</p>

<p>“I had dinner in Bridgeport,” said McGlory. “I was
mighty well treated, I’ll say that&mdash;and that only makes it
harder for me to understand what’s in the wind. I don’t
think any one would run away with us just for the fun
of the thing.”</p>

<p>“It would be more of a joke on the other fellows than
it would on us,” averred Matt, moving to the table and
taking a seat. “How long has this supper been here,
Joe?”</p>

<p>“About half an hour,” returned the cowboy, taking a
chair opposite his chum. “Random is here,” he said
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Random, of Random &amp; Griggs?” inquired Matt,
showing some surprise.</p>

<p>“What other Random could it be?”</p>

<p>Matt helped himself to a cold roast beef sandwich and
a glass of lemonade.</p>

<p>“Tell me what happened to you, Joe,” said he. “I can
eat and listen at the same time. Besides, I guess I’m
hungrier than you are. You had dinner, and I didn’t.”</p>

<p>McGlory told of his call at the Liberty Street office, of
meeting Random, of his talk with Random in the restaurant,
of Random’s going with him to the Flatiron Building,
of the failure to find Matt, and of the yarn told by
the driver of the red car.</p>

<p>“We came through the country lickety-whoop,” the
cowboy finished, “but it was the longest kind of a ride,
and I wondered what in Sam Hill you were doing ’way
over in Massachusetts. It was after sundown when we
got to this place. Some one met the driver of the red car
at the door, and said that Motor Matt hadn’t come yet,
and that we were to wait for him. Random and I came
into this room. By and by, a servant began to spread the
table for chuck-pile, but layin’ covers for only two. I
guessed a little about that, and asked the servant who
he was intending to leave out, Random or Motor Matt.
It was orders, he said, and that was all he knew about it.</p>

<p>“After a while, Random got up, told me to wait, and
said he would try and find some one who could tell him
something. Next thing I know, <em>you</em> walk in on me, and
the door is locked behind you. Speak to me about this!
Where’s Random?”</p>

<p>“The man’s name isn’t Random, Joe,” said Matt, “but
Tibbits.”</p>

<p>“Tibbits?” echoed McGlory blankly. “But he met me
at Random’s office.”</p>

<p>“That may be, but he’s Tibbits, just the same.”</p>

<p>“If he’s Tibbits, why did he tell me his label was Random?”</p>

<p>“Because that was part of the plot. By posing as Random,
Tibbits knew he would have a lot more influence
over you. He kept you from going to the bank, he accompanied
you to the Flatiron Building, and he came out
here with you. He might not have been able to do all
that if you had known he wasn’t Random, and that he
wasn’t interested in the ‘Pauper’s Dream.’”</p>

<p>The cowboy scowled, and drummed his fingers on the
table. Matt helped himself to a piece of pie, and another
glass of lemonade.</p>

<p>“Can’t you choke off, pard,” begged the cowboy, “and
tell me how they played tag with you? Sufferin’ tenterhooks,
but this business has got me all at sea.”</p>

<p>“I’m at sea, too,” said Matt, “but we’re pretty comfortable,
so far, and I guess we can wait a little for the
thing to work itself out. That’s the way with most mysteries.
If you leave them alone they’ll solve themselves.”</p>

<p>“What happened to you? Bat it up to me!”</p>

<p>Matt recounted the manner in which he had been beguiled
into the open country by the supposed messenger;
and he told about the accident to the taxicab, the revelation
that the supposed youth was a girl, the finding of
the driver, the passing of the red touring car with McGlory
in the tonneau, the work of Dimmock and Sanders,
a mile west of Rye, and the journey through Connecticut
and into Massachusetts, finishing with his meeting with
McGlory.</p>

<p>The cowboy listened, spellbound.</p>

<p>“You’ve had the hot end of this, so far, pard,” said he,
“and no mistake. But wouldn’t the whole game just naturally
rattle your spurs? What’s the good of it? How
are Tibbits, Dimmock, and the rest going to make anything
by their work?”</p>

<p>“That’s where I’m muddled, too,” acknowledged Matt,
drawing away from the table and resuming his easy-chair.
“I think, Joe, that Tibbits, who seems to have
been the one that planned this thing, has made an error.”</p>

<p>“That he’s bobbled, and thinks we’re some other
fellows?”</p>

<p>“Not that, exactly, for they appear to know a whole
lot about us, and our business. Where they’ve made
their mistake, it strikes me, is in thinking that we’re
mixed up in some affair we don’t know anything about.
If that’s the case, then the fact will come out, before
very long. All we’ve got to do is to wait until Tibbits
comes for a talk with us.”</p>

<p>“I’m hanged if I want to wait!” fumed McGlory.
“They’ve fooled us, they’ve got us here, and I’m a Piute
if I’m going to stay!”</p>

<p>Jumping up, he ran to one of the two windows of the
room. Pushing back the heavy hangings, he raised the
lower sash. As he did so, a voice called up from the
darkness outside:</p>

<p>“Git back in there, an’ close the winder! If ye don’t,
I’ll shoot.”</p>

<p>The cowboy appeared dashed.</p>

<p>“You might have expected that, Joe,” laughed Matt.
“You didn’t think, did you, that Tibbits would go to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
this trouble and then leave us free to leave the house if
we wanted to?”</p>

<p>McGlory closed the window and returned dazedly to
his chair.</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ poorhouses!” he mumbled. “I reckon they
think we’re millionaires in disguise, and that our folks
will hand over a lot of money to ransom us. The laugh’s
on them, and no mistake.”</p>

<p>“Let’s take things easy,” advised Matt, “until we can
learn more about the game the gang are playing.”</p>

<p>As Matt finished, the key rattled in the lock, the door
was pushed open, and Tibbits entered. He had some
wearing apparel thrown over his arm, and dropped it the
moment he was inside the room. The door was closed
behind him, by unseen hands, and again locked.</p>

<p>With an angry exclamation, McGlory sprang to his
feet and started toward Tibbits. The latter, with a quick
movement, brought out the weapon which Matt had already
become acquainted with.</p>

<p>“Steady,” warned Tibbits, smiling, but none the less
determined. “Let’s all be nice and comfortable,” he
begged, “and no harm will be done. You lads are my
guests. Consider yourselves so, and we’ll get along
swimmingly. It was a cold supper I provided, but it was
the best I could do, under the circumstances. If you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“See here, you!” shouted McGlory. “Tell me whether
your name is Tibbits or Random.”</p>

<p>“Tibbits,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“And you haven’t anything to do with that brokerage
firm in Liberty Street?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing. The first time I was ever there was this
morning.”</p>

<p>“What did you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If you’ll give me a chance, McGlory,” interposed Tibbits,
“I’ll explain everything to the complete satisfaction
of Motor Matt and yourself.”</p>

<p>“‘Complete satisfaction!’” muttered McGlory. “That
means you’re to fill a pretty big order. But go ahead,
Tibbits, and let’s find out where we stand.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX_A_DARING_PLOT" id="CHAPTER_IX_A_DARING_PLOT">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="titlefont">A DARING PLOT.</span></a></h2>


<p>“Let me assure you, in the first place,” said Tibbits,
still keeping his revolver prominently displayed, “that no
harm is intended either of you lads. You are to remain
here in these comfortable surroundings for a week. At
the end of that time you will be released, and can make
your way back to New York.”</p>

<p>“Guess again about that,” spoke up the cowboy. “There
are important doings for me in New York Wednesday,
and we’ll have to tear ourselves away from you by to-morrow
afternoon, at the latest.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to stay here a week,” insisted Tibbits.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” went on McGlory. “There’s
a meeting at the office of Random &amp; Griggs Wednesday
evening, and I’ve just got to be there. That’s all
there is to it.”</p>

<p>Tibbits fixed his glittering eyes on McGlory for a
moment.</p>

<p>“That excuse won’t do,” said he. “You can’t make up
a yarn like that out of whole cloth, and expect me to
swallow it.”</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ blockheads!” grunted McGlory. “There,
read that.”</p>

<p>Jerking the colonel’s letter from his pocket, McGlory
tossed it to Tibbits.</p>

<p>The latter removed the two folded sheets from the envelope.
After glancing at one, he stooped down and
pushed it under the door. The paper was caught and
drawn from sight by some one in the hall.</p>

<p>“The order for the bullion!” called Tibbits. “Got it,
Dimmock?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Dimmock, from the other side of the
door.</p>

<p>Tibbits placed the other sheet in the envelope and
flipped it back to McGlory.</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” said Tibbits. “It’s hardly necessary
to read the letter from the colonel. I heard Motor Matt
read it aloud to you in the hotel, this morning.”</p>

<p>Both boys were dazed by the light that suddenly
dawned upon them.</p>

<p>“You blamed tinhorn,” cried McGlory, “are you making
a play to get hold of those two bars of bullion?”</p>

<p>“And you never thought of it!” laughed Tibbits.
“What else did you suppose we were going to all this
trouble for? You wanted to call at the bank, and I didn’t
want you to. If you had gone there, the bank officials
would have seen you. That would have made it difficult
for me to palm off another Joe McGlory in your place. I
am obliged to you for giving up the order for the bullion
with so little persuasion on my part.”</p>

<p>The cowboy’s wrath was so great that he fairly hopped
up and down.</p>

<p>“You think you’re going to get away with this,” he
shouted, “but you’ll be fooled. You’re nothing more than
just a common thief, eh? And you live in a place like
this!” The cowboy looked around the room.</p>

<p>“I don’t live here&mdash;not regularly,” said Tibbits. “My
uncle lives here, and I’m taking care of the place while
he and his family are in Germany.” A sly leer accompanied
the words. “It was only by chance that I happened
to be in the hotel, this morning, and also by chance
that I overheard Motor Matt reading that letter from
Arizona. It looked like a fine opportunity to get hold
of some easy money. I’m a black sheep. My uncle, who
owns this place, thinks I’ve reformed, but he’s mistaken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
When opportunity knocks at my door, she finds me hospitable.
How long did it take me to find Dimmock after
I learned the contents of that letter, discovered what Joe
McGlory was going to do, and where he was to meet
Motor Matt after he had done it? Just fifteen minutes,
by the watch. Dimmock&mdash;his real name is not that&mdash;is
a gentleman of fallen fortunes. Wall Street ruined him.
He was as anxious as I to pick up a little ready money,
and he and Pearl entered heartily into the spirit of the
adventure. Dimmock knew Sanders. In happier days,
Sanders used to be Dimmock’s chauffeur. I left Dimmock,
Pearl, and Sanders to take care of Motor Matt,
while I gave my attention to McGlory. I had to have a
car and a chauffeur, but I knew where to find them. Pearl
is to play the rôle of Joe McGlory, and I’ve a lad for the
part of Motor Matt. They will dress themselves in your
clothes, call at the Merchants’ &amp; Miners’ with the order,
and get the bullion. They’ll not have any trouble.
The colonel has written the bank telling the cashier to
hand over the gold when McGlory comes for it with his
written order. It will be easy. Dimmock and I will
clean up nine thousand dollars, net, divide it equally, then
leave for parts unknown. You boys will be kept here for
a week, and then released. Dimmock, Pearl, and I will
be out of the way, long before that time. Rather clever, I
call all that. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>Certainly there was a fiendish cunning in it all, but it
was not the sort of “cleverness” that appealed to the
motor boys. They were awed by the very audacity of
the scheme, and by the facility with which the rest of the
plot could be carried out. Simply by keeping Matt and
McGlory cooped up in that house, Tibbits could have
Dimmock’s daughter and some one else play the parts of
the motor boys and secure the gold.</p>

<p>“You’re one of these tinhorns, Tibbits,” observed the
cowboy, “who’d stand up a stage or snake a game of
faro.”</p>

<p>“I’m not taking any money out of <em>your</em> pocket,” said
Tibbits.</p>

<p>“You’re robbing me of a fortune! If that gold isn’t
produced at the meeting in Random &amp; Griggs’ office,
the deal for the ‘Pauper’s Dream’ mine may fall through.
I’ve got a hundred shares of stock in the ‘Pauper’s
Dream.’”</p>

<p>“The deal won’t fall through just because the two bars
of bullion have been taken,” asserted Tibbits, “that is, not
if Random &amp; Griggs’ men really mean business.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know anything about that, Tibbits,” put in
Matt. “But, no matter whether the deal falls through or
not, you needn’t think that McGlory is going to agree to
let you do what you have planned with that bullion.”</p>

<p>“What will McGlory do?” chuckled Tibbits; “what
<em>can</em> he do? You boys are safely bottled up here. Dimmock
and I and Pearl and the other young fellow go
back to New York to-night. Some time to-morrow, before
the bank closes, we will have secured the bullion.
You boys will be here, and the rest of us will be&mdash;where
you can never find us.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty small stake to run such a risk for,” said
Matt.</p>

<p>“Beggars can’t be choosers,” said Tibbits coolly. “But
time presses. There”&mdash;and Tibbits pointed to the clothes
he had brought into the library&mdash;“is something for you
lads to put on. I’ll take the garments you’re wearing
now, if you please.”</p>

<p>“You’ll <em>take</em> ’em, all right,” answered McGlory defiantly,
“if you get ’em at all.”</p>

<p>“Come, come,” continued Tibbits impatiently. “I have
men enough to take the clothes by force, but I don’t want
to get them that way. Strip!”</p>

<p>Neither Matt nor McGlory made any move to obey the
command.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” observed Tibbits, “if you’re going to force
a rough and tumble, that’s your lookout. Dimmock!” he
called.</p>

<p>“What is it, Tibbits?” came Dimmock’s voice from the
hall.</p>

<p>“Come in, and bring Sanders and Riley.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” called Matt. With four armed men
against him and McGlory, Matt saw the futility of resistance.
“We’ll give you our clothes, Tibbits, but under
protest.”</p>

<p>“I’ll put the protest on file,” grinned Tibbits. “Never
mind bringing Sanders and Riley, Dimmock,” he shouted.</p>

<p>“I’m going to fight this out,” flared McGlory. “If they
get my clothes, they’ll get ’em in rags. What’s the good
of taking ’em, anyhow? The bank folks have never
seen either of us, Matt&mdash;Tibbits took precious good care
they shouldn’t see me.”</p>

<p>“As for that,” said Tibbits, “we want all the corroborative
detail we can give the rôles Pearl and the young fellow
are to play.”</p>

<p>Matt stepped over to McGlory.</p>

<p>“It won’t do any good to hang out, Joe,” he counseled,
in a low voice. “They’re too many for us. Let them go
ahead with their plan&mdash;we can’t stop that part of it&mdash;but
there may be something else we can do.”</p>

<p>“They’ve treated us like a couple of wooden Indians,”
sputtered the cowboy, “and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And we’ve acted like a couple,” finished Matt. “Why,
we never guessed what their scheme was until Tibbits
told us. Take everything out of your pockets, and let
them have your clothes. I’m going to do the same.”</p>

<p>With that, he began stripping his pockets of personal
property and laying it on the table. McGlory followed
suit. Then coats, trousers, and hats were thrown in a
heap, and the boys got into the garments Tibbits had
brought.</p>

<p>In point of quality, the clothes the boys now put on
were far and away better than the ones they had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
off. And the fit of them, too, was passably good; but it
chanced that McGlory’s outfit was a full dress suit, and
Matt’s was a Norfolk jacket outfit&mdash;a get-up he cordially
detested.</p>

<p>Tibbits remained until the boys were decked out in
their borrowed gear.</p>

<p>“I didn’t use much discrimination, in McGlory’s case,
and that’s a fact,” said Tibbits, with a laugh, “but I
brought what I could find in uncle’s wardrobe that
looked as though it would fit. I trust,” he added, with a
regret that was undoubtedly feigned, “that you lads won’t
cherish any hard feelings?”</p>

<p>“We’ll do all we can to block you,” answered McGlory,
“and will be tickled to death to see you behind the bars.
That’s the way we stack up.”</p>

<p>“You can’t get out of here, remember that,” proceeded
Tibbits, the clothes over one arm. “Try the windows,
and you’ll stop a bullet; break down the door, and you’ll
run into the same sort of trouble.”</p>

<p>He knocked on the door.</p>

<p>“I’m through in here, Dimmock,” he called. “Let me
out.”</p>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said Tibbits mockingly, and faded into the
hall.</p>

<p>McGlory roared wrathfully, and shook his fist at the
locked door. Motor Matt lowered himself into a chair
and grew thoughtful.</p>

<p>“And this,” grunted McGlory, “is what he calls explaining
matters to our ‘complete satisfaction.’ Satisfaction!
Sufferin’ Hottentots! Do I look satisfied?”</p>

<p>The cowboy, in his dress suit and boiling with rage,
looked far from satisfied. In fact, he presented such a
humorous spectacle that Matt laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he grunted disgustedly, “you’d laugh, Matt, if
you were going to be hung. But think what this means
to me! I want to dig up the hatchet and go on the war-path.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing we can do just now, Joe,” said Matt,
straightening his face.</p>

<p>“What sort of a girl is that daughter of Dimmock’s, to
go helping her father in lawless work like this?”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand her,” returned Matt. “But I can
tell you one thing.”</p>

<p>“Then tell it.”</p>

<p>“If Pearl Dimmock gets into your clothes and tries to
palm herself off as Joe McGlory, the bank people are
going to get suspicious.”</p>

<p>“She played the game on you, pard, and you didn’t get
suspicious until you got dumped out of the taxicab.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking more about you, then, than I was about
the supposed messenger. In the matter of the bank, the
case is different. Miss Dimmock goes in there, asks for
the bullion, and turns over the colonel’s order for it. The
order is all straight enough, but the bank won’t let go of
that gold until they’re sure the one who brings the order
is Joe McGlory. I’m thinking the hardest part of Tibbits’
work is yet to come, and that the chances are about
even whether he’ll win or lose.”</p>

<p>“We can’t leave it like that, pard. We’ve got to get
out of here and make a rush for New York. That’s all
there is to it. Tibbits, Dimmock, the girl, and the fellow
who’s to understudy you, will get away from here to-night.
That will leave fewer people to watch us, and I
don’t see why we can’t make a break, somehow, and carry
it through with ground to spare.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to consider it.”</p>

<p>“There’s not much time to think it over. New York’s
a long ways off, and we’ve got to get there by the time the
bank opens, to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily.”</p>

<p>McGlory’s face went blank.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, pard?” he queried.</p>

<p>Matt hitched his chair closer.</p>

<p>“Suppose we don’t get away from here until to-morrow
morning, Joe,” said he, “why couldn’t we send a
telegram to the bank? Wouldn’t that do just as well as
though we dropped in there personally?”</p>

<p>“I’m the prize blockhead, all right,” muttered McGlory.
“Of course, a telegram will do, in case we can’t get out
of here in time to reach New York before the bank opens.
But let’s try to break out.”</p>

<p>The cowboy got up and looked around reflectively.</p>

<p>“Where’ll we try first?” asked Matt.</p>

<p>“Watch me!” answered his chum, his face lighting up.
He made a dash for the fireplace.</p>

<p>“Here’s where this clawhammer suit catches it,” said
he, crawling into the opening.</p>

<p>The fireplace was large, and Matt waited eagerly, expecting
results. In a few moments, McGlory reappeared
with soot on his hands.</p>

<p>“Not any,” he muttered disappointedly. “There’s a
sharp turn in the flue, and the opening isn’t any more’n
six inches wide. No getting out by the chimney, pard.
I’ll try the window again, and see how careful I can be
when I lift it.”</p>

<p>McGlory pushed up the windows with very little noise,
but the vigilant guard outside heard him, nevertheless.</p>

<p>“Back in there,” was the gruff order, boomed from
the darkness, “or I’ll shake a bullet at ye.”</p>

<p>The cowboy closed the window.</p>

<p>“The galoot out there is right on the job,” said he,
and moved to the door.</p>

<p>Bending out a key ring, which he happened to have in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
his pocket, he contrived a picklock; but no sooner did he
begin operations than a voice from the hall ordered him
to stop.</p>

<p>“You see how it is, Joe,” whispered Matt. “The best
thing for us to do is to lie low for a while. Wait until
after Tibbits, Dimmock, and the others are away.”</p>

<p>“They must be away now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. I haven’t heard any motor cars
leaving the place; and, besides that, it will take some time
for Miss Dimmock and the fellow who’s to play Motor
Matt to get ready. Let’s try and get a little sleep, Joe.
If we have some rest, we’ll be better able to cope with
the situation later.”</p>

<p>“Sleep! Why, pard, I couldn’t sleep any more’n I
could fly&mdash;or aviate, without anything to aviate with.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m off for a nap by myself, then. Wake me,
Joe, if anything happens.”</p>

<p>Matt threw himself down on the couch, and was asleep
almost as soon as he had straightened out. It seemed to
him that he had no more than closed his eyes before he
felt a tug at his arm. He sat up quickly.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Listen,” returned McGlory.</p>

<p>What Matt heard was the distinct throbbing of an automobile,
dying swiftly into silence.</p>

<p>“They’re off,” said the cowboy.</p>

<p>“Did that machine leave the house?” Matt asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. Now, what are we going to do?”</p>

<p>“Try the window and the door again, Joe.”</p>

<p>The cowboy repeated his earlier attempts, only to be
gruffly warned by the vigilant guards, outside the house
and in the hall.</p>

<p>“How many men do you reckon Tibbits left here?”
growled McGlory.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew. He seems to have had quite a gang.”</p>

<p>“And they’re all after a little of that ten thousand dollars!”
muttered McGlory. “Pretty small pickings for
fellows like Dimmock and Tibbits. I can size them up
for that sort of grafters.”</p>

<p>“I think we’d better wait till morning before we make
any more attempts to get away,” said Matt.</p>

<p>“I reckon we’ll have to,” answered McGlory, in a discouraged
tone.</p>

<p>“What sort of fellow was that who came in here, last
night, and put our supper on the table?”</p>

<p>“A runt of a chap in an apron and a square white cap.
Why?”</p>

<p>“Nothing&mdash;now.”</p>

<p>Without any further remarks, Matt shifted his position
on the couch, and again went to sleep.</p>

<p>He awoke without being roused, and sat up on the edge
of the couch. Daylight was just glimmering through the
trees. McGlory, sprawled out on the carpet, with the
clawhammer coat rolled into a pillow, was slumbering
soundly.</p>

<p>Quietly Matt got up and went to the window, where
the cowboy had made his several attempts the night before.</p>

<p>The window looked off toward the stables. To the
right of the house was a vine-covered pergola, and between
the stables and the pergola ran the graveled drive,
leading around the house from the front gate. What interested
Matt particularly, however, was a red touring
car in the drive, close to the pergola.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was the same car that had brought
McGlory and Tibbits from New York. Tibbits and Dimmock,
on their return to the city, had used the other car&mdash;the
one driven by Sanders.</p>

<p>The presence of that car spelled possibilities for the
motor boys, if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Matt’s gaze dropped to the side of the house. A man
was sitting under the two library windows, smoking a
pipe. Across his knees rested a revolver.</p>

<p>Before the motor boys could avail themselves of the
red touring car they would have to eliminate the guard.
How could that be accomplished?</p>

<p>Matt turned from the window, revolving the problem
in his mind. He could think of no method of escape
short of boldly leaping from the window and trusting to
luck&mdash;and the revolver made such an attempt too risky.
A plan, which he had thought of vaguely during the
night, recurred to him. This idea had the servant for its
nucleus, and promised little better than a sortie by the
window.</p>

<p>McGlory, hearing his chum moving around the room,
stirred and sat up on the floor.</p>

<p>“What are you prowling around for, Matt?” he asked,
yawning sleepily.</p>

<p>“Averaging up the chances,” Matt answered. “Come
here, Joe.”</p>

<p>McGlory got up and went to his chum’s side. Matt
pointed to the red touring car.</p>

<p>“If we could get out of here and get hold of <em>that</em>,” he
murmured, “we might do something.”</p>

<p>“The boy with the gun looks sort of fierce,” reflected
the cowboy; “still, you never can tell just what a fellow’s
going to do with a revolver. If&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The key rattled in the lock. Matt dropped quickly
down on the couch and pretended to be asleep. McGlory,
taking his cue from Matt, resumed his place on the floor.</p>

<p>A man, in white cap and apron, entered the room with
a tray of steaming food. The door was closed and fastened
behind him. Without trying to waken the boys&mdash;whom
he must have supposed to be asleep&mdash;the man
picked his way around McGlory, placed the tray on the
table, and began collecting the scattered remnants of the
supper. His back was toward Matt.</p>

<p>Noiselessly as a gliding serpent, Matt arose and slipped
across the space separating him from the man; then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
leaning forward, he caught him about the middle with
his left arm, at the same time covering his lips with his
right hand.</p>

<p>The man began to squirm, kicking out with his feet
and fighting fiercely to get away.</p>

<p>McGlory, who had been watching the progress of
events, and wondering what Matt was trying to do, went
to his chum’s aid. The man was forced to his knees, and
then to the floor. Lying on his back, Matt’s hand still
over his mouth, he stared upward with frightened eyes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI_BOLD_WORK" id="CHAPTER_XI_BOLD_WORK">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="titlefont">BOLD WORK.</span></a></h2>


<p>“Softly, Joe, softly!” whispered Matt, stifling his own
heavy breathing. “Twist a couple of napkins into ropes.
Be quick!”</p>

<p>McGlory had not the least notion what Matt was trying
to accomplish, but he knew it was something which
might help their escape.</p>

<p>“Be quiet,” hissed Matt, in the man’s ear, “and you’ll
not be hurt, but if you move, or try to call out”&mdash;his
voice grew menacing&mdash;“you’ll wish you hadn’t!”</p>

<p>McGlory dropped to his knees with the two napkins
and began tying one of them about the prisoner’s ankles.
He followed this by knotting the other around the servant’s
wrists.</p>

<p>“What next?” he asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Put on the white cap and apron,” instructed Matt,
“then pick up the tray and rap on the door. When the
door’s opened, throw the tray in the face of the fellow in
the hall. There’ll be a commotion, and perhaps the guard
outside will leave the windows. If he does, I’ll get out
and make for the red car. Meet me somewhere along the
drive, this side the gate. It’s a desperate chance, Joe,
but it’s all we have.”</p>

<p>The cowboy chuckled delightedly as he removed the
apron from the prostrate prisoner and tied it about his
waist; then, picking up the cap, he set it on his head, and
grabbed the tray.</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” he whispered, stepping toward the door.
“Bravo, pard! It’s the reckless things that win!”</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” qualified Matt; “if you can’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The guard in the hall shook the doorknob.</p>

<p>“Why are you so long, Paul?” he called.</p>

<p>It was not Dimmock’s voice&mdash;proof that Dimmock had
really gone, and that another guard had taken his place.
The question put McGlory in a quandary. He and Matt
both recognized the dilemma, in a flash. The cowboy was
about to speak, presumably in an attempt to imitate the
servant’s voice, but Matt restrained him with a gesture.</p>

<p>“Tell the man outside you’re coming&mdash;tell him to open
the door!”</p>

<p>Matt King hissed the words in the prisoner’s ear, and
lifted the hand he was using for a gag.</p>

<p>One word from the servant would ruin every chance.
Was the fellow frightened enough to do Matt’s bidding?
McGlory looked over his shoulder and glared savagely at
the man on the floor.</p>

<p>“Paul!” cried the guard, once more rattling the door.</p>

<p>“I’m coming,” said the man, but with a shiver of dread
in his voice. “Open the door, Miles!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, anyhow?” grumbled
Miles. “You’ve been in there more’n five minutes.”</p>

<p>As the door opened, McGlory temporarily deceiving
Miles with the tray and the white cap and apron, stepped
out.</p>

<p>“Are they asleep,” began Miles, “or&mdash;&mdash;Thunder!”
the guard broke off; “you’re not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The cry was interrupted by a smash of dishes. There
came a yell from Miles, a snarling shout from McGlory,
and then the impact of a heavy blow. After that, running
feet could be heard, and the opening of a door.</p>

<p>“Help!” roared Miles; “this way, Barney! The
prisoners are on the hike!”</p>

<p>Matt, paying no more attention to the servant, jumped
for the door. He saw a mess of food and broken crockery
in the hall, and daylight entering through the open
door. Miles was just vanishing in pursuit of McGlory.</p>

<p>It was now Matt’s turn to see what he could do. Was
“Barney” the man on guard below the windows? If he
was, and if he had answered Miles’ call, then the way
was clear in that direction. But there was not a second
to be lost. If McGlory got away, he would need the red
car. And so would Matt, for that matter. If the automobile
was left behind, the baffled guards would use it in
giving pursuit.</p>

<p>In two leaps Matt was at the window and looking out.
Barney’s chair was empty!</p>

<p>To throw up the window and leap to the ground took
only a moment, and Matt immediately laid a straight line
for the automobile.</p>

<p>He was not long in covering the distance that separated
him from the car, but many doubts flashed through his
mind while he was on the way.</p>

<p>If the switch plug had been removed, if the gasoline or
oil was low, if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But he was hoping for the best, and the best came his
way, then, when the smiles of fortune were so grievously
needed.</p>

<p>Whether there was any one in his vicinity, or not, he
did not take time to discover. Reaching the front of the
car&mdash;which, by good luck, was pointing in the direction
of the pike&mdash;he grabbed frantically at the crank, and
gave it a heave.</p>

<p><em>Chuff, chuff, chuff-chuff!</em> The sputter died impotently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Manipulating the switch, and the lever controlling
the fuel supply, he tried again. This time the engine
was successfully “turned over,” and took up its cycle.</p>

<p>“Hi, there!” called a voice from the direction of the
stables. “Stop, I tell ye!”</p>

<p>Matt had no time for the approaching man, but leaped
into the car, and was off. A detonation sounded above
the noise of the laboring motor, and something whistled
viciously past Matt’s ear.</p>

<p>But, by then, the lad’s blood was hot for success, and
he would have dared anything.</p>

<p>Like a thing of life the red car leaped around the
corner of the house, taking a sharp curve with two
wheels in the air. Only a short distance separated the
fleeing car from the gate, but between the gate and the
car was one of the guards. Matt knew at a glance it was
not Barney. The chances were that it was Miles.</p>

<p>“Halt!” yelled the man.</p>

<p>“Get out of the way,” shouted Matt, “or I’ll run over
you!”</p>

<p>The man got out of the way, hurling himself from the
road barely in the nick of time. He did not appear to be
armed; at any rate, no lead followed Matt.</p>

<p>But where was McGlory? Matt had no sooner begun
to worry about his chum than the cowboy, breathless
from running, staggered from behind a clump of lilac
bushes and flung up his hands.</p>

<p>With a hasty look behind, Matt slowed the machine.</p>

<p>“It’s all up with us,” puffed McGlory, hanging over
the edge of the car. “We’ll have to leave the machine
and take to our heels.”</p>

<p>“Why?” flashed Matt.</p>

<p>“The gates are locked.”</p>

<p>For an instant Matt was stunned. The gates&mdash;locked!
Of course, they would be locked! Why had he not
thought of that when he was planning to use the red car
for their escape?</p>

<p>“We’ll never get away if we trust to our heels, Joe,”
said Matt grimly. “Get in&mdash;be quick!”</p>

<p>By that time, Miles had been joined by Barney, and
by the man who had called to Matt from the stables.
The three, feeling sure that they had the car in a trap,
were advancing cautiously, watching to see what the boys
would do next.</p>

<p>McGlory did not know what plan Matt had formed;
but, nevertheless, he scrambled into the tonneau.</p>

<p>“How’ll you get past the gates?” cried the cowboy,
standing erect in the tonneau, and clinging to the coat
rail.</p>

<p>“Get down in the bottom of the tonneau!” ordered
Matt, without looking around.</p>

<p>Little by little he let the car out, and the iron barriers
came threateningly into view. When a hundred feet
away from them the car was going so fast that the gates
seemed to be jumping toward it.</p>

<p>But the purpose of his daring comrade was clear to
McGlory, and the idea left him gasping.</p>

<p>Matt was going to storm the gates! He was hurling
the red car toward them like a cannon ball.</p>

<p>The cowboy fell limply down behind the front seats,
wondering vaguely where he and Matt would be after the
smash.</p>

<p>Even as the thought formed in his mind, there came a
crash, a jar that shook the automobile in every part, and
made it reel drunkenly, and a clash of broken glass. After
a wild stagger, the car seemed to gather itself for a
spring; then it flung itself onward into the road, turned,
and glided off on the straightaway.</p>

<p>Dazed and bewildered, McGlory lifted himself in the
rocking tonneau and looked at Matt, who was still in the
driver’s seat, still bending over the wheel, and still coaxing
the demoralized red flyer to its best gait.</p>

<p>Certainly the car was demoralized&mdash;not internally, for
the motor was doing its work nobly&mdash;but the bonnet was
bent and broken, the lamps were smashed, and the woodwork
splintered and scarred.</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ earthquakes!” gasped McGlory, looking back
at the gates.</p>

<p>The gates had been torn ajar, and one of them had been
plucked bodily off the brick pier from which it had
swung.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, pard?” cried McGlory.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Matt, “but it was rather a close call
for the tires.”</p>

<p>“Tires? Hang the tires! It was a close call for <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“Not so close as you’d think. I knew if we could force
the gates we’d get through safely. Each gate would give
way in a solid piece, and there’d be no splinters. We
made it, Joe, we made it!”</p>

<p>“But the car has been damaged&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t help that, Joe! If we keep Tibbits and
Dimmock from carrying out that robbery, we have to get
to a telegraph office in short order.”</p>

<p>At that moment the motor showed signs of distress.
First it missed fire, and then went dead altogether.</p>

<p>“Watch behind, Joe,” called Matt, as he sprang into
the road and began an investigation to discover what was
wrong.</p>

<span class="titlefont">PURSUIT.</span></a></h2>


<p>“Sufferin’ cyclones!” exclaimed McGlory, keeping close
watch of the road behind; “after that jolt it would be a
wonder, pard, if something didn’t go wrong with the
motor. By rights, considering what this car has gone
through, it ought to be a scrap heap.”</p>

<p>Matt adjusted one of the battery wires, then crawled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
under the car with a wrench. The cowboy could hear
him at work; but he could hear something else, too, and
that was a patter of hoofs and a grind of wheels.</p>

<p>“Horse and buggy coming, Matt!” he called. “Miles
and Barney are hot after us. I took Miles’ gun away
from him, and I can use it, if you say so.”</p>

<p>“Not on your life, Joe!” Matt answered, crawling from
under the car and looking back over the road. “That
would complicate the affair. We’re not to do any fighting,
but just show our heels. We’re on the defensive
entirely&mdash;remember that.”</p>

<p>The horse, driven by Miles, was coming at a gallop.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what they want horses and buggies at that
big house for,” growled McGlory. “Automobiles go with
a place like that&mdash;and when the family’s in Europe, the
bubble-wagons ought to all be in a Boston garage. Will
the motor work now, Matt, or have we got to use our
heels?”</p>

<p>The car started. The motor was still somewhat out of
order, but gave the car a speed that easily carried it away
from the horse and buggy.</p>

<p>“I reckon we’ll get clear, pard,” observed McGlory,
albeit with an anxious, questioning note in his voice.</p>

<p>“We’ll kill the engine again,” answered Matt, “if we
keep running it while it’s out of order.”</p>

<p>“Then, kill it, but get as far away from Miles and
Barney, and as near a telegraph office, as you can, before
we have to take to the woods.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about this country,” said Matt.
“What is the nearest town in this direction, Joe?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been trying to think of that ever since we got
through the gates, and headed this way, but I can’t seem
to remember, pard.”</p>

<p>“It’s poor policy, Joe, to run the engine to a standstill.
Everything may depend on the car before we get out of
these woods.”</p>

<p>The motor was rapidly going from bad to worse. Matt
stopped suddenly, threw on the reverse, and backed the
car into the bushes.</p>

<p>“What’s that for?” asked the cowboy.</p>

<p>“I’m hoping Miles and Barney will pass us, and give
us a little time to do some more tinkering,” replied Matt.</p>

<p>“Even if that rig does pass us, we can’t follow it.”</p>

<p>“We can go the other way, Joe. I think the nearest
town is in that direction, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to pass that house again?”</p>

<p>“Why not? I don’t think there are enough men left
at the place to interfere with us.”</p>

<p>Matt got down and began pulling up the bent bushes
in front of the car. While he was at work, the galloping
horse could be heard, and he drew back hastily, and knelt
down to see what happened.</p>

<p>There was no occasion for alarm. Miles and Barney
dashed past without giving so much as a glance in the
direction of the motor boys.</p>

<p>“Good enough!” exclaimed McGlory. “There’s the
chance you wanted, Matt. Can I do anything to help you
fix the car?”</p>

<p>“Two of us can shorten the work a whole lot,” said
Matt.</p>

<p>He showed McGlory what to do, and for ten minutes
both boys were busy. At the end of that time, Matt announced
that he was fairly well satisfied with the repairs.</p>

<p>“There’s enough gasoline and oil to take us fifty
miles,” he added.</p>

<p>“In other words,” said the cowboy, “we can go clear
to Boston, if we have to. What time is it, pard?”</p>

<p>“Nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>McGlory was startled.</p>

<p>“Nine o’clock!” he repeated. “We’ve got to have a telegram
on the wires by ten. Let’s pull out and hit the
high places.”</p>

<p>There was no indication, so far as the boys could see,
that Miles and Barney had discovered the trick which
the boys had played on them. If the two men were coming
back, they were still a good way off.</p>

<p>The steady hum of the motor, when Matt started it,
filled the boys with delight. There did not seem any
doubt but that the machine would perform every duty demanded
of it. Matt put on the high speed, and they
darted back over the course which they had recently covered.</p>

<p>As they drew near they watched anxiously for some
sign of those who still remained at the house. No man
showed himself, however, and the car flung past the
wrecked gates and bore away northward.</p>

<p>“Miles and Barney are welcome to catch us&mdash;if they
can,” exulted McGlory, who was riding in front with
Matt.</p>

<p>The wind of the motor boys’ flight whistled and sang
in their ears, and the engine continued to hum merrily
and steadily. There was a good deal of rattling, for the
mudguards and footboards were loose, but the motor
itself was working as well as the day it had come from
the factory.</p>

<p>“Sanders must have gone with Tibbits and Dimmock,”
remarked Matt.</p>

<p>“There was quite a party of pirates in that other car,”
said McGlory.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see Miles or Barney before we broke
out of the house, Joe?”</p>

<p>“I never saw Barney, Matt, but Miles was the fellow
who brought Tibbits and me from New York.”</p>

<p>“You must have had quite a set-to with Miles in the
hall.”</p>

<p>“Speak to me about that!” laughed McGlory. “Miles
was one surprised man, and don’t you forget it, pard.
The skirmish was short, and I reckon it was the tray of
chuck that did the work for the shuffer. He got the hot
coffee full in his face, and when he fell back he dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
his revolver. I hit him once, just to give me time to
pick up the gun, and then I made for the front door.
If that had been locked&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>McGlory winced.</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t,” said Matt. “I heard you rush out of
the house, and I got to the hall door just in time to see
Miles going after you. He gave you quite a run, didn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“I ran till I was black in the face, Matt, doubling back,
dodging around flower beds, and getting mixed up with
all kinds of horticultural arrangements. Gee, man, but
that’s a fine old place to be used by such a gang!”</p>

<p>“It will cost a hundred or two to repair those gates.”</p>

<p>“And two or three hundred, I reckon, to get this car
back in its usual shape.”</p>

<p>“More than that, Joe. I don’t think five hundred will
repair the car as it was before we used it for a battering-ram.”</p>

<p>“That ten thousand in bullion is costing the tinhorns
pretty dear,” commented the cowboy.</p>

<p>“They’ll not be paying anything for damages. If Miles
owns this car, he’s the one that foots this part of the
bill.”</p>

<p>The cowboy laughed.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet Miles pretty near had an attack of heart
failure when he saw you aiming the car at those iron
gates, and giving it full speed ahead!”</p>

<p>“We can understand why Miles is so eager to catch us,
I think,” answered Matt.</p>

<p>McGlory’s thoughts went off on another tack.</p>

<p>“About what time was it, do you think,” he asked,
“when Tibbits and his gang left the house, last night?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t look at my watch,” said Matt. “How long
had I been asleep when you awoke me?”</p>

<p>“About two hours.”</p>

<p>“Then it was nearly midnight when the car pulled
out.”</p>

<p>“How long would it take that outfit to reach New
York?”</p>

<p>This was rather an important point. Up to that moment,
Matt had not given it much thought.</p>

<p>“I should think,” said he, after a little reflection, “that
the trip would take eight or ten hours. The car would
have to hit a smart clip, at that, and keep it up.”</p>

<p>“Then Tibbits and his gang couldn’t reach the city
before nine or ten o’clock?” queried McGlory.</p>

<p>“I don’t think they could.”</p>

<p>“I reckon there’s plenty of hope, yet,” and the cowboy
heaved a long breath. “There’s a house, Matt,” he
added abruptly. “We’re getting out of the woods.”</p>

<p>“We’ll probably see a town pretty soon. Wonder what
the speed limit is through the villages in this part of the
country?”</p>

<p>“Never mind the speed limit, pard. Keep her wide
open.”</p>

<p>Five minutes more of rapid traveling saw the houses
thicken along the road. People began to be seen, and
two or three machines were passed.</p>

<p>“Better slow down,” a passenger in one of the cars
called to the boys as they scurried past. “They’ll nab
you in Leeville if you don’t.”</p>

<p>Matt thought the advice good, and heeded it.</p>

<p>The disreputable appearance of the red car excited a
good deal of curiosity. McGlory, too, came in for a fair
share of guying. He had on the dress suit, of course,
and, although he had lost the white cap, he still wore the
apron.</p>

<p>“I’ve been too excited to think about the apron,” he
laughed, removing the object, and casting it into the
road. “I’m wearing this dress suit, I reckon, at the
wrong end of the day, but I can’t get rid of that for a
while yet.”</p>

<p>Neither of the boys had a hat, but that fact was of
minor importance.</p>

<p>A turn in the road brought them into the outskirts of
a village. The road itself formed the main street of the
place, and while the boys were jogging at a very leisurely
gait toward the huddle of store buildings, a man in a
flannel shirt and with his trousers tucked in his boot tops,
jumped across the road, dragging a rattling chain behind
him.</p>

<p>One end of the chain was fastened to a tree, and before
the battered car reached the man, the other end had been
similarly secured.</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ blockades!” cried McGlory, as Matt shut
off the power and put on the brake. “What’s the matter
with that Rube?”</p>

<p>The man who had manipulated the chain advanced
upon the boys from his side of the road, a badge of authority
in the form of a tin star. At the same moment,
another man descended upon the car from the opposite
side of the pike.</p>

<p>“This looks as though it might prove interesting,” muttered
Matt. “What do you want?” he called to the man
with the star.</p>

<p>“My name’s Hawkins,” snapped the officer, “and I’m
town constable. You two fellers are pinched.”</p>

<p>“Pinched?” echoed McGlory. “Why, neighbor, we
weren’t going eight miles an hour.”</p>

<p>“I don’t keer a blame how fast ye was goin’,” proceeded
the constable aggressively. “That ain’t why ye’re
arrested. Got a telephone message from the old Higbee
place, sayin’ as how two fellers, answerin’ your description,
had stole a motor car. Hiram an’ me’ll jest
git in an’ ride with ye to the lockup.”</p>

<p>Telephone! The motor boys had entirely forgotten
that modern, everyday convenience.</p>

<p>They had been trapped in Leeville&mdash;and a telephone
message had turned the trick!</p>

<span class="titlefont">IN AND OUT OF LEEVILLE.</span></a></h2>


<p>“Mr. Hawkins,” said Matt, attempting to argue the
matter, and show the constable the error of his way,
“you’re a little mistaken in this matter.”</p>

<p>“’Way wide of the trail,” chipped in McGlory.</p>

<p>“You can’t teach me no law,” scowled the constable.
“I know my business.”</p>

<p>“Of course you do,” went on Matt, signing to McGlory
to let him do the talking. “I’m not saying that
you don’t know all about the law, or are not trying to do
your duty. It’s the fellow at the other end of the line
who has started you wrong.”</p>

<p>“D’you own this car?” demanded Hawkins, slapping
the broken hood.</p>

<p>“No, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you run away with it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but if you’ll let&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I calculate that’s a-plenty,” cut in Hawkins, with a
triumphant look at Hiram. “We’ll hop in an’ show ye
the way to the jail.”</p>

<p>“I want to explain this,” cried Matt.</p>

<p>“Oh, ye do!” gibed the constable. “I can tell, just by
the look of you, you’re a pair of scalawags. You can’t do
any explainin’ that’ll help your case any.”</p>

<p>“Take us before a justice,” pleaded Matt.</p>

<p>“The jedge is away, fishin’, an’ he won’t hold court
till this arternoon. I’ll haul ye up in front o’ him, soon
enough, an’ if he don’t hold ye to a higher court to answer
for the larceny of one benzine buggy, I’ll miss <em>my</em>
guess. Hiram,” and the constable turned to his comrade,
“I’ll git in with ’em, so’st to make sure they don’t
run, then you take down the chain, an’ git in, too.”</p>

<p>“You bet I will,” assented Hiram, with great alacrity.</p>

<p>“Is there a telegraph office in town?” asked Matt,
while Hiram was removing the chain.</p>

<p>“’Course there is,” replied Hawkins. “We got a railroad,
too, and an op’ry house, and everythin’ else that
makes a town worth livin’ in.”</p>

<p>“We want to stop at the telegraph office and send a
message,” said Matt.</p>

<p>“No, ye don’t! You fellers can’t play any shenanigin
tricks on Bill Hawkins. I’m too old a hand to be come
over by two younkers like you.”</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ jaybirds!” growled McGlory. “Say, constable,
this message we want to send is mighty important.
If we can get it through, it will prevent a ten-thousand-dollar
robbery in New York.”</p>

<p>Bill Hawkins laughed.</p>

<p>“You’re funnier’n a Joe Miller joke book,” said he.
“Jest as though ye could make me swaller a yarn like
that. Git in, Hiram,” he added. “You drive this automobile
right down Main Street till I tell ye to stop,” he
finished, addressing Matt.</p>

<p>“Will you let me send that telegram?” pleaded McGlory.
“It will only take a minute.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess not,” said the constable, snapping his
lean jaws decisively. “Start the car,” he ordered sternly.</p>

<p>Matt took two five-dollar bills from his pocket, offering
one to each of the men.</p>

<p>“You can read the telegram, Mr. Hawkins,” said Matt.
“It’s important.”</p>

<p>Hawkins went up on his toes and fairly bristled.</p>

<p>“Say,” he snorted, “you ain’t got money enough to
bribe me from doin’ my duty. Now I <em>know</em> ye’re
crooked. Tryin’ to bribe Bill Hawkins! Well, by jing!
What d’ye think o’ that, Hiram?”</p>

<p>“Scand’lous!” gurgled Hiram, horror-stricken.</p>

<p>McGlory leaned toward Matt.</p>

<p>“Put on full speed, pard,” he whispered excitedly,
“and let’s snake ’em out into the country.”</p>

<p>But Matt shook his head and started the car slowly
into the village.</p>

<p>All the inhabitants of the place, Matt judged, had been
drawn to the scene of the “arrest.” Men, women, children,
and dogs clustered around the car, and proceeded
with it as it took its melancholy way along the street.</p>

<p>“There’s the place,” said Hawkins, pointing, “that two-story
red buildin’ on the right. Hardware store on the
first floor and the jail’s upstairs.”</p>

<p>Matt steered for the curb, and halted the car at the
edge of the walk, then Hawkins took him in charge,
Hiram looked after McGlory, and the motor boys were
led toward an outside stairway by which they were to
climb to the “jail.”</p>

<p>The cowboy, halting at the foot of the stairs, renewed
his desperate attempt to get permission to send his telegram.
Hiram spoke harshly, Hawkins put in a few warm
words, and the crowd jeered. Then McGlory gave up,
and followed Hawkins and Matt as they climbed the
stairs.</p>

<p>The second floor of the building was partitioned into
two rooms. A sign proclaimed that the front room was
occupied by a “Justice of the Peace,” while another sign,
bearing the one word, “Jail,” set forth the uses to which
the rear room was put.</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory, it appeared, were the only occupants
of the jail. The room was meagrely furnished,
with a table, a cot, and two chairs, and there were two
grated windows overlooking the rear of the premises.</p>

<p>Here the motor boys were left, McGlory sinking disconsolately
into one of the chairs, while Matt roamed
around, making himself as familiar as possible with the
situation.</p>

<p>From the grated windows he could look off for half a
block to the railroad station. The station building was
about as large as a good-sized packing case, and there
was one spur track, running between the main track and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the rear of the hardware store, with a lonely flat car on
the rails.</p>

<p>“Here’s a go!” wailed McGlory. “Jugged! Jugged by
a country constable, just when a telegram might save the
day for us in New York! Sufferin’ cats! Can’t we do
something, pard? We’re not going to let a couple of
hayseeds knock us out like this, are we?”</p>

<p>Matt was trying the bars at the windows. The ends
of the bars were set into the wood of the casing, and the
casing was old, and partly decayed.</p>

<p>“We can break out,” said Matt, “but what good will
that do us, Joe? We’d be apprehended by the villagers
before you could get to the telegraph office. It won’t be
possible to send a message from here.”</p>

<p>“How can we send it from anywhere,” cried the cowboy,
“if we don’t get away from this place?”</p>

<p>“Jail-breakers are apt to have quite a hard time of it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take my chances on the hard time if we can make
a getaway.”</p>

<p>“The only thing for us to do, so far as I can see, is to
wait till the judge gets back from his fishing trip. We
can talk to <em>him</em>, and he’ll have to listen to us.”</p>

<p>Matt sat down, and McGlory, grumbling his disgust,
started up and went to one of the windows. Laying hold
of a bar he gave it a wrench, breaking the end completely
out of the wood. A gap was left, through which the
boys might squeeze their way to liberty&mdash;if it seemed
advisable.</p>

<p>“There’s a shed under the window,” reported McGlory.
“We could get out on the shed and reach the ground too
easy for any use.”</p>

<p>“That part of it is all right,” returned Matt, “but how
could we get out of town without being seen? There’s
the rub, Joe. Be guided by me, and let’s wait for the
justice.”</p>

<p>“There’s no telling when he’ll get here. Why, right
now, this minute, Tibbits may have his pals at the bank!”</p>

<p>Urged on by his frantic thoughts, the cowboy began
hoisting the window. In a few moments, a path to freedom,
through the bars and over the shed roof, lay open
to the motor boys.</p>

<p>“Let’s make a try of it, pard,” pleaded McGlory. “We
can reach the spur track, crawl along it through the
bushes, and maybe get out of the town. Then we can
hoof it to the next town, drop in at a telegraph office&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And find a telegram from Leeville asking the authorities
to capture and hold us as jail-breakers,” said Matt.</p>

<p>“We haven’t done anything we ought to be jugged for,
have we?” demanded McGlory.</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s right for us to get away if we can, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Joe, but I don’t see how we can manage it.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment a distant whistle was heard.</p>

<p>“A train!” exclaimed McGlory. “If it stops here,
Matt, why can’t we&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Matt caught the inspiration of his chum’s words.
Again fortune was favoring him and McGlory. There
was a chance to escape, but they would have to be quick
if they took advantage of it.</p>

<p>“Crawl through the window, Joe!” whispered Matt.
“Be wary! The jig’s up if we’re seen.”</p>

<p>The cowboy began at once crowding himself through
the bars. He succeeded, and alighted on the roof of the
shed on hands and knees. Matt followed, made his way
carefully over the top of the shed, dropped from the edge
of the roof, and found himself beside his chum at the
rear of the hardware store.</p>

<p>The train was just pulling into the station. Without
losing a moment, the boys scrambled over a fence, skirmished
onward under the screen of the flat car, dodged
beneath it, raced across the narrow stretch separating the
spur from the main track, and climbed aboard the forward
coach of the train.</p>

<p>The station was on the other side of the cars, and, so
far as the boys could discover, not an inhabitant of the
village had seen them.</p>

<p>Where the train was going they did not know; but they
did know that it would halt at a more friendly town than
Leeville, that there would be a telegraph office in the
town, and that they could forward their message to New
York.</p>

<p>“In and out of Leeville,” murmured the cowboy, as he
and Matt sank breathlessly into a seat. “I reckon old
Bill Hawkins will have another guess coming, eh?”</p>

<p>The conductor, when he came through the train collecting
tickets, was somewhat taken aback at the sight of
Matt and McGlory.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get on?” he inquired, looking the boys
over and grinning a little at McGlory’s bare head and
dress suit.</p>

<p>“At Leeville,” said Matt.</p>

<p>“There was only one man got on at Leeville. I didn’t
see you.”</p>

<p>“We climbed aboard the train on the side that was
away from the station,” explained McGlory. “We were
in a rush, and got aboard the handiest way we could.”</p>

<p>“You were in so big a rush that you forgot your hats,”
commented the conductor suspiciously. “Where are you
going?”</p>

<p>“Where does this train go, conductor?” put in Matt.</p>

<p>“Fall River.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll pay our fares to Fall River,” and Matt
handed the conductor a bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re a queer pair, and no mistake,” said the railroad
man, while making change.</p>

<p>“What’s the next stop?” continued Matt.</p>

<p>“Stoughton.”</p>

<p>“Do you stop long enough at Stoughton so we could
get off and send a telegram?”</p>

<p>“You have the message all written out and I guess
you’ll have time.”</p>

<p>With a puzzled look at the boys, the conductor left the
car.</p>

<p>Matt, on the back of the colonel’s letter to McGlory,
began writing out the message.</p>

<p>“Mark it ‘rush’” said McGlory, “and address it to
the cashier of the Merchants’ &amp; Miners’ National.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got that,” answered Matt.</p>

<p>Then, as plainly as he could, he wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Order for two bars bullion, given to Joe McGlory by
Colonel M. A. Billings, of Tucson, Arizona, stolen. If
presented, hold bullion until you hear from me.</p>

<p class="marginrightindent">“<span class="smcap">Joe McGlory.</span>”</p></blockquote>

<p>Matt handed the message to his chum to read.</p>

<p>“That’ll do the trick,” said McGlory, “providing the
gold hasn’t already been delivered. I hope that car of
Tibbits’ broke down somewhere, and that he was hung
up for a few hours on the road to New York. That’s our
only hope, Matt.”</p>

<p>Before Matt could answer, the conductor came along
the aisle, ushering a gray-whiskered man who was carrying
a carpetbag.</p>

<p>“Here they are,” said the conductor to his companion,
halting opposite the boys. “Do you know them?”</p>

<p>“Well, by hokey!” ejaculated the other, staring at the
motor boys as though they were a couple of ghosts.</p>

<p>“Know them?” repeated the conductor.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen ’em, conductor,” was the reply. “Bill Hawkins,
our town constable, arrested them two fellers for
stealin’ an automobile, an’ they was put in the lockup
not more’n an hour ago. How the nation did you fellers
git out?”</p>

<p>That was not a time to dodge responsibility. The
truth, and the whole truth, must be told.</p>

<p>“I had an idea something was wrong with you two
chaps,” frowned the conductor. “This man”&mdash;he nodded
to the gray-bearded stranger&mdash;“got on at Leeville, so I
thought I’d bring him forward to have a look at you.
Surprising information he’s giving me. What have you
got to say for yourselves?”</p>

<p>Sternness had crept into the conductor’s voice.</p>

<p>“The gentleman from Leeville is telling the truth,” replied
Matt. “I and my chum <em>were</em> arrested by the constable
and put in the Leeville town jail, but we twisted a
bar from the window, crawled over the roof of a shed,
and caught this train.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” gasped the man from Leeville.</p>

<p>“You’ll get off at Stoughton, all right,” said the conductor,
“but it’ll be for something beside sending a telegram.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, conductor,” begged Matt. “If you
and the other gentleman have time to listen, I want to
tell you just what happened. We’ll be as quick as we
can.”</p>

<p>The conductor hesitated.</p>

<p>“There are two sides to a story, you know,” went on
Matt earnestly. “You’ve got one side, and now, in justice
to us, you ought to have ours.”</p>

<p>There was something in Matt’s steady gray eyes that
lent a powerful appeal to his words. The conductor,
turning back the forward seat, motioned to the man from
Leeville to sit by the window.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the conductor, sitting down, “I haven’t got
much time. We’ll be at Stoughton in fifteen minutes.
Fire away.”</p>

<p>A good deal of detail was necessary, if Matt wanted to
make out a strong case for himself and McGlory, so he
began with the receipt of the colonel’s letter by his chum,
and offered the letter in evidence. It was read by both
the conductor and the Leeville man.</p>

<p>Then, taking events in sequence, Matt went over his
and McGlory’s experiences during the preceding day,
while they were prisoners in the old Higbee house and
while they were fighting for their freedom.</p>

<p>It was an exciting story, and was listened to with deepest
interest, not only by the conductor and the Leeville
man, but also by two or three other passengers, as well.</p>

<p>“By hokey,” murmured the Leeville man, when the
recital was finished, “if that’s the truth, young feller, you
an’ your friend ought to have a medal. I never heard
anythin’ like it before.”</p>

<p>“You said you wanted to send a telegram from Stoughton,”
observed the conductor. “Who was the telegram
going to?”</p>

<p>“To the New York bank,” replied Matt, “in order to
keep the bullion from being delivered to Tibbits and his
gang.”</p>

<p>“Have you written out the message?”</p>

<p>“Here it is,” and Matt turned over the colonel’s letter
and showed the message to the trainman.</p>

<p>The conductor read it through carefully, and then read
it aloud to the man from Leeville.</p>

<p>“To my mind,” said the conductor, “this is evidence
that these lads are telling the truth. They wrote that
message before I brought you here to identify them, so
they couldn’t have framed it up to get out of a tight
place.”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure they’re tellin’ the truth,” returned the
man from Leeville, “because their story holds together.
Mr. Higbee, I happen to know, has a nephew who’s a
good deal of a black sheep. His name ain’t Tibbits, but
it ain’t likely he’d have given his real name while doin’
underhand work like what he was up to. Mr. Higbee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
too, left this nephew at the country place to look after
it while he an’ his family are abroad.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bank on Motor Matt and Joe McGlory!” declared
the conductor, reaching over to slap each of the boys
on the shoulder. “If that Leeville constable had known
as much as the law allows, he’d have given the lads
a chance to tell their side of the story; and for him to
refuse to let them send such an important telegram was
an outrage. I hope,” the conductor added to Matt, “that
the message will be received in time to save the bullion.
In order to make sure that it is rushed through, you’d
better let me attend to the sending of it myself.”</p>

<p>“That’s mighty kind of you,” said Matt gratefully.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, my lad,” the trainman answered.
“I’m glad to be able to do something for you.”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to Fall River to visit my married daughter,”
put in the Leeville man, “an’ when I git back home, I’ll
let Hawkins know what I think of his fool way of doing
bizness. It’ll cost him his job, next ’lection, you can lay
to that.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t bear down too hard on him,” counseled
Matt. “Hawkins thought he was doing his duty.”</p>

<p>“He’s a false alarm,” growled McGlory, “and he ought
to have the pin pulled on him. Maybe I’ve lost a fortune
through his foolishness&mdash;I don’t know.”</p>

<p>At that juncture the train began to slow down.</p>

<p>“Stoughton!” called the conductor, getting up and
making for the rear door of the car.</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory watched the conductor as he crossed
the station platform and disappeared inside the telegraph
office. He was gone for a couple of minutes, and when
he reappeared he signaled for the train to pull out.</p>

<p>“That’s done, my lads,” he announced, when he again
came into the car. “In less than half an hour the telegram
should be in the hands of the cashier.”</p>

<p>“I hope to gracious it’ll git there in time,” said the
Leeville man. “I’d hate to have it said that ten thousand
dollars was lost jest because a constable in our town
hadn’t sense enough to do the right thing.”</p>

<p>“Something ought to be done to the rest of that rascally
gang at the old Higbee house,” suggested the conductor.</p>

<p>“It’s too late for that,” said Matt. “As soon as Joe and
I got clear away from them, the scoundrels probably proceeded
to make themselves scarce.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet they’re absent a whole lot,” chimed in the
cowboy. “It was a good deal of scheming they did just
for a measly ten thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“That sum is plenty large enough to make a whole lot
of men go wrong,” asserted the conductor. “But, say,
I’d like to have a picture of you two boys breaking
through those iron gates in that automobile! It’s a wonder
you didn’t get killed.”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” breathed the man from Leeville.
“You ought to’ve seen them gates, conductor. I’ve seen
’em, dozens o’ times. They’re big, an’ high, an’ hinged to
heavy brick columns. It’s a miracle that car wasn’t
smashed to kindlin’ wood, an’ the youngsters along with
it.”</p>

<p>“I was pretty sure we’d get through,” said Matt, “or
we wouldn’t have tried it.”</p>

<p>“He’s the lad to figure things out,” expanded McGlory
proudly. “His mind works like a rapid-fire gun, an’ it
ain’t often he misses the bull’s-eye, either.”</p>

<p>“I guess you hit it off about right,” laughed the conductor.
“I’m glad you had the nerve to tell me the whole
story, Motor Matt, and that you didn’t try to dodge
when I confronted you with this gentleman from Leeville.
What you’ve said has made me your friend, and
I’ll bet the Leeville man feels the same way.”</p>

<p>“You bet he does,” avowed that gentleman, with emphasis.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV_AT_THE_BANK" id="CHAPTER_XV_AT_THE_BANK">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="titlefont">AT THE BANK.</span></a></h2>


<p>It was about two o’clock in the afternoon when a touring
car drew up in front of the Merchants’ &amp; Miners’
Bank. There were five passengers in the automobile&mdash;four
besides the driver.</p>

<p>The driver was Sanders, and beside Sanders sat Tibbits.
In the tonneau were Dimmock, his daughter, and a
young fellow who wore clothes that were a very poor fit
and who seemed exceedingly nervous.</p>

<p>“Buck up!” admonished Dimmock to the young man.
“Show what you’re made of now, Charley.”</p>

<p>“I’ll&mdash;I’ll do the best I can,” answered Charley.</p>

<p>“Let <em>me</em> do the talking,” said Miss Dimmock.</p>

<p>The girl’s attire was scarcely better, in the matter of fit,
than was Charley’s, but she wore her costume with an
easy grace that made up for any of the other shortcomings.</p>

<p>“We’ll wait for you around the corner,” said Tibbits,
as the girl and the young fellow got out.</p>

<p>There was a worried look on Dimmock’s face as the
touring car left the front of the bank and moved slowly
along the street.</p>

<p>“It’s a lot of trouble and risk we’re taking for ten
thousand dollars,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“You’ve taken more trouble and risk for less, Dimmock,”
said Tibbits.</p>

<p>“I have, yes,” admitted the other, his face gray with
anxiety, “but never before have I asked Pearl to help
me in such a matter. It will be the last time.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” sneered Tibbits.</p>

<p>Meantime, the girl and Charley had entered the bank.
Charley’s nervousness had increased to a painful degree.
The frosty blue eyes of the girl, observing his abstracted
manner, led her to infer that Charley, so far from being a
help, would prove a source of danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“You stay back here, Motor Matt,” she whispered,
“and I’ll talk with the cashier alone.”</p>

<p>Charley was only too glad to receive a command of
that kind. Leaning against a writing desk at the wall,
he watched his companion as she boldly made her way
to the railing behind which the cashier transacted his
business. Something like admiration awoke in Charley’s
soul&mdash;that is, if there can be anything admirable in such
an attempt as the girl was about to make.</p>

<p>The long, yellow tresses had been cut from the girl’s
head&mdash;a sacrifice demanded by the exigencies of the case.</p>

<p>The cashier, as it chanced, was busy with some one
else. Calmly and patiently the girl waited. Finally the
other customer went away, and the girl pushed respectfully
up to the railing and stood under the sharp eyes of
the bank official.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you?” asked the cashier briskly.</p>

<p>“This will explain, I think,” said the girl, presenting
the colonel’s order for the bullion.</p>

<p>The cashier glanced at the order, then gave the girl a
keen scrutiny.</p>

<p>“You are Joe McGlory, are you?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Are you personally acquainted with the gentleman
who sent you this order?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>It was a pity, indeed, that Dimmock should have forced
his daughter into such a tangle of deception; and doubly
a pity that one so young and fair could have played the
despicable part so boldly, and given her false answers
without a tremor, or a pang of conscience.</p>

<p>“Have you any other means of identifying yourself?”
went on the cashier.</p>

<p>Here was the place where the supposed Motor Matt
was to be used, but Charley had not proved equal to the
part.</p>

<p>“I’m a stranger in town,” said the girl, “and I had supposed
that order of the colonel’s was enough.”</p>

<p>“Our orders are to deliver the bullion upon the presentation
of this demand. You understand, Mr. McGlory,
that we are simply acting as trustees for Colonel
Billings.”</p>

<p>The cashier looked at the paper reflectively. He had
many important matters on his mind, matters in which
hundreds of thousands were concerned, and two gold bars
were a mere bagatelle.</p>

<p>Again he studied the girl. She met his eyes frankly.</p>

<p>“After all,” said the cashier, “this order lets us out.
I will give you a receipt to sign, and while you are putting
your name to it, I will have the bullion brought from
the safe.”</p>

<p>He scribbled a few words on a pad of printed receipt
blanks, tore off the top slip and handed it to the girl, nodding
his head toward a writing desk. Pearl stepped to
the desk, and the cashier pressed an electric call for one
of the bank attachés.</p>

<p>The employee who answered the call brought with him
a telegram.</p>

<p>“That message just came, sir,” said he, “and is marked
‘rush.’”</p>

<p>The cashier took the message.</p>

<p>“Get me that bag of bullion from the vault, Jenkins,”
said he, tearing the end off the yellow envelope, “the two
bars of gold from Colonel Billings, of Tucson, Arizona.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p>Jenkins started. The cashier read the telegram at a
glance. Not a line in his face quivered.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jenkins!” he called.</p>

<p>The clerk came back.</p>

<p>“Instead of getting the bullion,” said the cashier, in a
low voice, “bring the bank policeman.”</p>

<p>Jenkins nodded and started of again, this time in a different
direction.</p>

<p>“Here is the receipt, sir,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“Ah,” smiled the cashier, getting up and opening a
wicket. “It will take some little time to get the bullion,
Mr. McGlory, and you had better step into my private
room and wait. Keep the receipt until you receive the
gold. That is only business, you know.”</p>

<p>He led the girl across the open space in front of his
desk, pushed ajar a door, and waved the girl into the
private room; then, returning to his chair, he waited.</p>

<p>Meantime, Jenkins had found the bank policeman.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hamilton wants you at once, George,” said
Jenkins.</p>

<p>Charley overheard the words, and he had already seen
the cashier talking with Jenkins and ushering the girl
into the private room. That was quite enough for
Charley, and he left the bank in a hurry.</p>

<p>“What is it, Mr. Hamilton?” asked the policeman,
leaning over the cashier’s railing.</p>

<p>The cashier handed up the message for the policeman
to read.</p>

<p>“That sounds business-like, Mr. Hamilton,” said the
policeman, dropping the message on the cashier’s desk.</p>

<p>“Very much so, George.”</p>

<p>“It’s from Stoughton, Massachusetts.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If the order comes in here, we can arrest the man
that brings it.”</p>

<p>“It has already been handed in, George. Here it is.”</p>

<p>A startled look crossed the policeman’s face.</p>

<p>“Was the bullion delivered?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not yet. A young man who says he is Joe McGlory
is in my private room. You know what to do. Take him
out the side entrance so there won’t be a scene out front.”</p>

<p>The policeman passed through the wicket and entered
the private room. The cashier turned, serene as ever, to
give a greeting to one of the bank’s customers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>A call from the door of his private room caused the
cashier to turn.</p>

<p>“Just a moment, Mr. Hamilton,” said the policeman.</p>

<p>The cashier stepped to the door, and the policeman
took his arm and drew him inside.</p>

<p>The room was empty!</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, the cashier showed annoyance
and concern.</p>

<p>“How do you suppose that happened, George?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>The policeman pointed to an open window.</p>

<p>“I have always said, Mr. Hamilton,” he remarked,
clinching a point that he had been hammering at for a
long time, “that you ought to have bars across that window.
All the other windows are protected, and that one
should be. The fellow got out, dropped ten feet to the
alley, and has escaped.”</p>

<p>“But why did he leave?” queried the cashier. “I am
sure he didn’t learn anything from me.”</p>

<p>“Chaps of that sort are naturally suspicious. The mere
fact that you asked him into the private room was
enough.”</p>

<p>“See if there is any trace of him outside. He’s a
youngish chap, seventeen or eighteen, I should say, rather
effeminate in appearance, and wears&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I saw him when he came in, sir,” broke in the policeman.
“It will be useless to hunt for him, but I’ll see what
I can do.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” and the cashier laughed as the policeman
hurried away, “we’ve got the bullion.”</p>

<p>What was it that had aroused Pearl Dimmock’s suspicions?
Only the secret workings of her own mind could
reveal that point. Perhaps, at the last moment, her courage
failed her, and she could not carry out the plan.
This would be the charitable supposition.</p>

<p>Yet, be that as it may, the girl vanished, and even her
sex remained a mystery to the cashier and the policeman.
The telegram, sent from Stoughton by the motor boys,
had fulfilled its mission. That the girl had escaped was,
to them, an unimportant detail. The main thing was to
foil Tibbits and keep the bullion.</p>

<span class="titlefont">A CLOSE SHAVE.</span></a></h2>


<p>Motor Matt and Joe McGlory reached Fall River in
the afternoon. They had planned to catch one of the
night boats for New York, and there was an hour or two
at their disposal. They put in the time to good advantage
buying clothes. Mr. Jacobs, the man from Leeville, was
familiar with the town and, before going to his daughter’s,
was glad to show the boys around and give them all
the aid he could.</p>

<p>When he left Matt and McGlory, the lads were completely
equipped in new “hand-me-downs,” and feeling
more like themselves.</p>

<p>There was a little fear, on their part, that Bill Hawkins
might have used the telegraph lines and that they would
have trouble in Fall River. But the trouble did not materialize.</p>

<p>“We’re jail-breakers, all right,” laughed McGlory,
when they were safely in their stateroom aboard the
sound steamer, “but Constable Bill, I reckon, has found
out something about Miles and Barney that keeps him
from running out our trail.”</p>

<p>“Hawkins and his friend Hiram,” said Matt, “have
discovered that they’ve made a mistake. I don’t see how
they could have learned this from Miles or Barney,
though, and I’m rather inclined to think that the justice
of the peace got back from his fishing trip and said a few
words in our behalf.”</p>

<p>“What’s the difference, pard, so long as we’re at large?
We’ve lost two suits of clothes and collided with a lot of
hard knocks, but we got that telegram off.”</p>

<p>“Also,” laughed Matt, “we’ve spoiled a pair of nice
iron gates, destroyed some Higbee china, and played hob
with one of the finest motor cars I ever handled. I guess
the damage isn’t all on one side.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be ‘completely satisfied,’ as Tibbits remarked,
when I learn that the bullion has been saved.”</p>

<p>“We’ll discover that to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The motor boys slept their way down the sound, and
reached New York early enough to go to their hotel and
have breakfast before the bank opened. Immediately
after breakfast they took an elevated train for downtown.</p>

<p>“I’ve connected with a good lesson, pard, during this
taxicab tangle,” remarked McGlory.</p>

<p>The cowboy was constantly thinking of various matters
connected with recent experiences, and entering them on
the profit side of his personal account.</p>

<p>“What’s this one, Joe?” asked Matt.</p>

<p>“Never to read an important letter aloud in a public
place. That’s the thing that got us into this mix with
Tibbits. He happened to be in this hotel, and he happened
to hear the letter. After that&mdash;well, I reckon the
memory of what happened is still pretty green.”</p>

<p>It was with some trepidation that the boys entered the
Merchants’ &amp; Miners’ Bank and made their way to the
cashier’s desk.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>It was the same brusque query which the cashier put so
many times a day that its use had become a habit.</p>

<p>“You can do a whole lot for me, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">amigo</i>,” said McGlory.
“Principally, though, I’m pining to learn whether two
gold bars from Tucson, Arizona, are still in your strong
box.”</p>

<p>The cashier was interested at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why do you ask?” he inquired, leaning back in his
chair and studying the faces of the boys.</p>

<p>He was a proficient reader of character; as a matter of
fact, he had to be. The ability to take a man’s sizing at a
glance had saved him from many a pitfall.</p>

<p>“Now you’re hitting me right at home,” said the cowboy.
“If that gold is here, I’m the happiest maverick
that ever strayed from the Southwest; if it’s not here, I’m
due to get unpleasant tidings from the colonel. You see,
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">amigo</i>, I’m the easy mark they call Joe McGlory.”</p>

<p>A slow smile was working its way over the cashier’s
face. There was something open and free about Joe
McGlory&mdash;too free, at times, those who did not know
him might have been tempted to think.</p>

<p>“You don’t look much like the Joe McGlory who came
here yesterday,” remarked the cashier casually.</p>

<p>The cowboy lopped down on the railing.</p>

<p>“I’m going to ask for a hot flat and a cup of ginger
tea in a minute,” he murmured dejectedly. “Friend, was
there a yellow-haired stranger here yesterday, in my
clothes?”</p>

<p>“Such a person called. Whether he wore your clothes,
or not, of course I can’t say.”</p>

<p>“Woosh! Johnny Hardluck is getting ready to hand
me one. Stand close, Matt. I’m going to need you, I
reckon. Yes, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">amigo</i>, they were my clothes. Did she
give you an order from the colonel for the bullion?”</p>

<p>“She?” echoed the cashier, lifting his brows.</p>

<p>“Of course you couldn’t know that,” said McGlory,
“but the fellow who claimed to be me was a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">moharrie</i>.
She gave you the colonel’s order and you handed her the
gold?”</p>

<p>“No. I had her sign a receipt and was just about to
send for the gold when a telegram arrived. I had&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Just a minute, please. I had the young woman step
into my private room, and instead of sending for the
gold I sent for the bank policeman. When he went into
the room to arrest the girl, she had vanished. Something,
I suppose, had aroused her suspicions. At any rate, she
slipped from a window and made good her escape. I’m
very sorry it happened. It is a blow at law and order
for such a would-be criminal to get away.”</p>

<p>The cowboy stared; then a glow overspread his face,
and he grabbed for the cashier’s hand.</p>

<p>“Sorry!” he exclaimed. “Why, pard, this isn’t a time
to be sorry about anything! You’ve still got the colonel’s
gold in your safe, and I’m the happiest stray in all New
York! You hear that, Matt?” and he whirled and caught
his chum by both hands. “It was a close shave, but that
message of ours did the trick! The gold’s here, and Tibbits
has been done&mdash;done to a turn! If there weren’t so
many people around, I’d yell.”</p>

<p>“You say you’re Joe McGlory?” said the cashier casually,
“but I’m from Missouri&mdash;after what happened yesterday.
You haven’t the colonel’s order, and even that
isn’t a safe means of identification. How are you going
to prove you’re Joe McGlory?”</p>

<p>“My pard, Motor Matt, will go on record. Matt, am
I McGlory, Joseph Easy-mark McGlory?”</p>

<p>“You’re Joe McGlory, all right,” laughed Matt.</p>

<p>“That’s good, as far as it goes,” said the cashier, “but
who’s to vouch for Motor Matt?”</p>

<p>“That’s me, pard,” bubbled McGlory. “We vouch for
each other.”</p>

<p>The cashier joined in the merriment of the motor boys.</p>

<p>“You’re a team,” said the cashier.</p>

<p>“A whole team and something to spare,” chuckled the
cowboy. “Honest, I’m feeling so good over that bullion
that I’m nearly locoed.”</p>

<p>“This will help to identify us,” said Matt.</p>

<p>He took from his pocket the letter McGlory had received
from the colonel. The conductor, when sending
the telegram from Stoughton, had had the message copied
on a telegraph blank and had returned the letter to
Matt.</p>

<p>The cashier read the letter carefully.</p>

<p>“This also is good&mdash;as far as it goes,” he remarked.
“The order for the bullion came with this?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you lads sent me a telegram yesterday?”</p>

<p>“You can bet your roll-top desk against a copper cent
we did. If you knew how we had to work to get that
telegram off to you, you’d rather think we sent it.”</p>

<p>This, of course, was from the cowboy.</p>

<p>“Where was the message sent from?”</p>

<p>“From Stoughton, Massachusetts. Turn that letter
over, neighbor, and you’ll find a copy of the message on
the back of it.”</p>

<p>The cashier read the copy.</p>

<p>“That’s good circumstantial evidence, Mr. McGlory,”
said he, handing the letter to the cowboy, “and you can
have the colonel’s gold whenever you come after it. Will
you take it now?”</p>

<p>“The meeting of the syndicate is called for to-night, at
the office of Random &amp; Griggs,” said McGlory, “and I
don’t want those two bars until the last thing before the
bank closes at three o’clock. That bullion has caused
trouble enough, and I’m putting up my fences against
any more.”</p>

<p>“Very well; come at three and you’ll get the gold.”</p>

<p>The boys turned and slowly left the bank.</p>

<p>“Somehow,” said the cowboy, “I’m glad that girl got
away.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” answered Motor Matt.</p>

<h2><a name="FACE_TO_FACE_WITH_A_MAD_DOG" id="FACE_TO_FACE_WITH_A_MAD_DOG">FACE TO FACE WITH A MAD DOG.</a></h2>


<p>“I can’t say that I object very much to the muzzling order,”
remarked Captain Peyton. “I have had too many
experiences with mad dogs, and my voyage with one of them
I am never likely to forget.”</p>

<p>“How was that?” we inquired eagerly; and after a little
pressing the captain spun us the following yarn:</p>

<p>The thing happened, he began, on board the ship <em>Globe</em>,
when I was a young man before the mast, coming home in
her from Denmark.</p>

<p>Our captain had procured the animal for a friend of his,
who lived somewhere in the country, and wanted such a dog
to keep off tramps and other trespassers.</p>

<p>I have seldom seen a larger or more vicious-looking dog.
He was of the breed called the Great Dane, a kind noted for
size and fierceness; and though only a year old, he did honor
to both these characteristics.</p>

<p>He would make friends with no one forward, and sometimes
would even show his large white teeth upon a too
familiar caress from the captain, his master pro tem.</p>

<p>You may be sure that not a single one of us ever kicked
that dog out of the way or took any other liberty with him.</p>

<p>“That animal will be a treasure to Captain Gale’s friend,”
the second mate remarked one day. “Why, if I had him I
should expect to come home some afternoon to find my wife
in half a dozen pieces, and my children lying about in little
strips. What can a man be thinking of to want such a
creature as that about the place?”</p>

<p>We used to think that he had more teeth than other dogs&mdash;at
least, his mouth appeared absolutely full of them&mdash;two
great, white shining rows that it made one shudder to see.</p>

<p>Once he snapped at little Roy Drew, the ship’s “boy,” and
took a piece out of his duck trousers, but without tearing his
flesh.</p>

<p>Fortunately Captain Gale was at hand, and a loud, quick
shout from him prevented any further demonstration. He
accused Roy of carelessness, and said the dog would not have
attempted to hurt him if he had been minding his business.</p>

<p>Roy was dreadfully frightened, though, for it was a narrow
escape.</p>

<p>“That dog ought to be chained up,” said the first mate.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” retorted Captain Gale obstinately, “the animal
will not hurt any one if left alone, and the men must
not meddle with him if they do not wish to be bitten.”</p>

<p>After a time the brute began to lose his appetite. He
slept more than usual, and at last refused his food altogether.
There was evidently something the matter with him.</p>

<p>“It would be an awkward matter for us if he had hydrophobia,”
said the first mate.</p>

<p>“He might easily do so,” replied the second mate. “They
say dogs generally behave like that before going mad.”</p>

<p>We sailors also felt rather uneasy; but the captain, as
usual, treated the matter very lightly.</p>

<p>“He may die, of course,” he said, as the mate suggested
some precaution, “but I won’t have him killed; and as to
tying him up just because he won’t eat, I shan’t do that
either. He may be all right again in a day or two.”</p>

<p>Although the animal slept much, he would often get up
and turn around as if he were not easy in any position. His
eyes, too, had a very strange, glassy stare.</p>

<p>He remained in this state for a week, sometimes moving a
few feet, but generally asleep.</p>

<p>He growled at every one who came near him, and I believe
that even the captain, although too obstinate to acknowledge
it, would at last have been glad to see him
knocked on the head.</p>

<p>When the crisis finally came, it came suddenly. Most of
the foremast hands were aloft in the rigging, I myself being
in the maintop. The mate was busy somewhere about the
deck, and the captain was leaning over the quarter rail,
watching his opportunity to strike a porpoise which had
come under the ship’s counter.</p>

<p>Presently we heard him shout to the mate:</p>

<p>“I’ve got him, Mr. Gibson! Come and lend a hand.”</p>

<p>The officer hurried to assist him; but at that moment another
cry came from the man at the wheel:</p>

<p>“Look out, Captain Gale! Look out, Mr. Gibson! The
dog is raving mad!”</p>

<p>As he spoke he let go of the wheel and sprang for the
mizzen rigging. The captain and mate, looking hastily
round, saw the mad brute close behind them, leaping up
aimlessly and snapping at the air. I need not tell you that
they went into the shrouds probably more quickly than they
had ever done before.</p>

<p>Every one not already aloft got there without loss of time,
so that the deck was soon entirely deserted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the dog was traversing the deck at a brisk
trot, snapping at everything in his way.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would come to a full stop and spring
straight up; at others he would tear away at some large rope,
as if trying to devour it. Occasionally he uttered a wild,
dismal howl.</p>

<p>What was to be done? Had he been a small dog we might
have attacked and killed him with handspikes; but with so
large and powerful a creature the case was different.</p>

<p>The captain had a revolver in the cabin, but while we were
becalmed off the Orkney Islands he had shot away all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
cartridges at sea birds that came near the ship, so that now
the firearm was useless.</p>

<p>All this while the ship was left to herself, the topsails
backing and filling, and the spanker moving from side to
side.</p>

<p>“Why not try to lasso the brute?” called out the mate at
last.</p>

<p>The captain thought the suggestion worth acting upon,
and a number of us going down to the foot of the shrouds,
attempted to take off some coils of the running rigging from
the pins.</p>

<p>But the dog was there before us, and, leaping up, he fixed
his teeth in the shrouds in a way that showed what would
be our fate if we did not keep out of his reach.</p>

<p>However, as some of us were on one side of the ship and
some on the other, we finally succeeded in getting at the
slack of some of the ropes, and then, standing well up in the
shrouds, we did our best at lasso-throwing. But we were
no cowboys, and all our efforts resulted in failure.</p>

<p>Our attempts served only to irritate the rabid animal, so
that he was now perfectly frantic, leaping, howling, and
rushing about in a terrible manner.</p>

<p>Just as we had begun to despair of effecting anything in
this way we heard a shout from forward. It was little Roy
Drew.</p>

<p>“Hello, there!” he said; “I’m on the bowsprit. I’ve just
come down the forestay. I see how he can be got overboard.”</p>

<p>As we stood in the shrouds, the ship’s fore and main
courses, which were set, prevented us from seeing the boy,
but we could easily judge of his position and intention also.</p>

<p>“Look out for yourself, Roy!” was the cry from more
than one voice, as all realized the fearful risk that he ran.</p>

<p>But the little fellow had his plan. He made a great stamping
and shouting, and the dog, which happened just then to
be forward, leaped upon the forecastle.</p>

<p>We, who were in the rigging, hurried down to the deck,
no longer thinking of any danger to ourselves, and then the
whole scene was before us.</p>

<p>Roy had run out along the bowsprit and jib-boom, and the
dog was trying to follow him.</p>

<p>The upper side of the bowsprit being flat, the mad animal
could easily traverse it, but we did not believe that he would
be able to walk on the jib-boom. To our great alarm, however,
we saw him dash out upon it without falling.</p>

<p>“Roy! Roy!” we called, “take care of yourself&mdash;quick!
quick! Don’t let him get hold of you!”</p>

<p>But the lad was prepared even for this. Away out on the
end of the boom he stood, with his hand on the flying jibstay,
and when the dog was within a few feet of him, he grasped
the hoops of the sail which were around it and went up the
log rope like a squirrel.</p>

<p>The mad dog made a sort of half leap, as if to reach him,
staggered, lost his balance, and fell with a splash under the
ship’s bows.</p>

<p>Probably the sudden immersion threw him into one of
those convulsive fits so common in the rabies, for, after a
few minutes of violent tumbling, he sank outright, and we
saw no more of him.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Captain Gale, after all was over and the ship
had been put upon her course, “I’ll finish catching my porpoise.”</p>

<p>And, sure enough, upon going to his line, he found the
iron still fast to it.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the voyage, concluded Captain
Peyton, little Roy Drew was the hero of the ship. He had
performed what all the rest of us combined had been unable
to accomplish, and even the captain gave him full credit for
his gallant act.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BOOMERANG" id="THE_BOOMERANG">THE BOOMERANG.</a></h2>


<p>Since the memorable time when Captain Cook sailed into
Botany Bay in 1769 and saw the naked native Australian
poising erect to hurl his peculiar weapon, the boomerang has
continued to excite the curiosity and amazement of the
civilized world; and truly the finding of such a scientific
weapon in the hands of this so-called lowest order of mankind
is an astonishing fact, to be simply accepted as another
oddity of this odd, topsy-turvy corner of the world.</p>

<p>This novel weapon became an intensely interesting object
to me very soon after arriving in Australia; and for the
purpose of studying it, I went persistently among the black
fellows, whose friendship I cultivated in different ways, and
so succeeded eventually in learning how to make and throw
the boomerang. So far, well and good; but of its history I
could learn nothing. Of the origin of the crooked stick
there is no knowledge; one can only conjecture. It is possible
it may have been born with the race itself from the accidental
throwing of a flat stick; for from childhood the black
fellow shows a natural bent for throwing things, as you can
see by watching him use his only other weapons, the spear
and club. The bow and arrow, so common in other lands,
is not used, except in the extreme northern portion of the
great island continent, where there is a mixture of the race
with the Papuan of New Guinea.</p>

<p>There are the war boomerang, hunting boomerang, and
amusement boomerang. This last is used for light hunting,
such as killing ducks, cockatoos, and parrots, and is the one
that is referred to when speaking of the boomerang. These
sticks measure from a foot and a half to three feet and a half
in length, the fighting and hunting ones being the largest and
heaviest. The hardest and toughest wood is selected, and
the form of the weapon follows the grain of the wood; thus,
if the crook of the root or limb is little or much, so is the
form of the boomerang. You will find that nearly every one
is of a different shape. In my collection I have them varying
from almost straight to a shape like that of the letter V,
nearly straight, curved, plain, ornamented, some with
strange carvings, and all varying according to different sections
of the country and individual tribes, each having its
own make or style, showing respectively rough crudeness or
considerable finish, and being especially characteristic in the
ends or points&mdash;all of which a boomerang connoisseur will
distinguish at once, and locate as to tribe and section.</p>

<p>In the black fellow’s humpy, where he keeps his collection
thrown down in a corner with a pile of spears, clubs, rags,
bark, and skins of kangaroo and wallaby, I have seen very
rare and curious specimens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The nomad black fellow makes his primitive humpy, or hut,
in a location chosen temporarily, according to his necessities
for hunting, fishing, and the like, by cutting a young sapling
half through about four feet from the ground, and bending it
over to a horizontal position, thus forming a ridge pole,
against which boughs and strips of bark are laid. The covered
side is always against the wind, and before the open
front a fire is always burning or smouldering. He does not
like the wind, and if it changes, presto! the humpy, too, is
changed in a twinkling.</p>

<p>Down in this humpy corner, underneath the pile of bark
and skins, he will burrow like a rabbit when he goes to sleep,
and from the same place he will provide himself with a
weapon when starting off for a hunt.</p>

<p>I have been with him at various times and in sundry
places, but remember particularly one tramp with a tall,
bushy-headed fellow, whom somebody had appropriately
named Long Green.</p>

<p>Starting from the humpy, we crossed a little stretch of
scrubby country, and struck into the sun-fretted gum-tree
forest, locally known as “the bush.” The black fellow is
always on the alert for crooked boughs or roots, and as we
trudged on Long Green in his quiet way kept his keen eyes
on duty. Nothing escaped the observation of this child of
the bush&mdash;bird or animal, crooked stick, stripping bark, or
foot track, all were so many letters on the familiar page of
his only book, the book of Nature. However, finding nothing
near, he led the way in and out to a spot where he was
sure of getting crooked roots. When a suitable one was
found and cut away by Long Green’s hatchet, we turned our
faces humpyward.</p>

<p>Arrived at the camp, fresh fuel was put on the smouldering
fire, the embers were blown into a lively flame, and then
the black fellow began operations by splitting the crook into
slabs, cutting them thinner and thinner until of the required
thickness. This was the first step in the making of a boomerang.
The next was to put the slabs on the fire, where we
watched them roasting and sizzling, for they were green and
full of sap. In this state the wood is very pliable, and from
time to time he took a crook off, held it between his toes,
knees, and teeth, and twisted out all its inequalities. I have
noticed that these people use their teeth with great dexterity.</p>

<p>More chipping, then more roasting, and the growing boomerang
was now and again tossed carelessly on the ground just
to see how it would act, while he glanced at it sideways, gave
it a poke with his foot, and reminded me of a sedate old tom
cat playing with a mouse. At last he gave it a gentle shy
along the ground; then a stronger motion. It was buoyant,
satisfactory. For the finishing off, it was scraped with a
piece of broken bottle, the edges sharpened all around, and it
was done&mdash;the boomerang was made! “White fellow, boss,
chuck!” he said, handing it to me. It weighed about half a
pound; the under side was rather flat, yet not entirely so, and
the upper side slightly rounded, with the ends a little thinner
than the centre. It was about half an inch thick and two and
a half inches broad. After having amused myself while he
was making another, I handed it back to him and told him
to “chuck.” It proved to be a very good one, and he entertained
me with it for a long time. It is held with the flat
side down and the concave edge forward, and is thrown from
over the shoulder. At the moment when it leaves the hand
it must be in an upright or perpendicular position.</p>

<p>The black fellow, with a short run and a grunt, sent the
thing with a sudden jerk at an angle of some twenty-five degrees.
After whirling through the air for nearly two hundred
feet it began to rise, and its flight curved toward the
left, taking in a circle of a hundred yards or more in diameter,
and fell close to our feet, while throughout its whole
course of nearly a thousand feet it kept up a harsh, whirring
sound, like the wings of a partridge in full flight, the rotary
motion giving it the appearance of a ring or wheel moving
through space. He caused it to form in its course the figure
eight a hundred yards in length, then again he sent it off in a
horizontal direction for a hundred feet or more, when it
quite suddenly turned and flew upward to a great height. It
would wheel along the ground in a straight course and also
in a circle, apparently possessed of some power in itself,
and the black fellow would jump up and down, talking and
ejaculating to it as though it understood him. He was an
excellent thrower, and made it perform two and even three
circles before falling to the ground. At his will it went from
right to left, and from left to right. Most all boomerangs
go but one way, being made for that purpose only.</p>

<p>Now, all this seems contrary to the laws of nature and
mathematics; but it is all right, and all the eccentric movements
of the boomerang can be accounted for on scientific
principles. Projectile force, rotary motion, and gravitation
do it all, and though these are big words they mean something.
You must not expect to throw it successfully without
long practice. It is dangerous, too, in the hands of a beginner,
for it is then that it “shows off,” and is liable to run
wild and chase some bystander in a most vigorous manner.
It is all very amusing to see a man running to escape, but
he invariably runs the wrong way; and, if hit, it might be
a serious matter for him.</p>

<p>There were several other humpies near by in the bush, and
whenever my black fellow threw the boomerang the other
fellows would shout “kout kout!” meaning “look out!” and
the women would seize the little naked blacks, and cuff them,
and tumble them into the humpies in a most unceremonious
manner; notwithstanding, their little black heads were soon
peeping out again. The larger boys, of some six or eight
years, were not interfered with, and they would run about
and bring the boomerangs which fell at a distance, for before
we got through there were several black fellows with
their boomerangs in the game. It was great fun. They
stood in a row, I among them, and we sent the boomerangs
chasing through the air. Some were thrown in one direction,
some the opposite, passing each other in their flight;
and as they began to return I had to hop about in a lively
way. The black fellows ditto.</p>

<p>The boomerang has a favorite trick of hiding itself in
the grass or bushes, and I have looked for one in vain in
an open field, and given it up as lost, when, on returning the
next day, it was found at once. But they cannot hide from
these little black fellows. They have most wonderful eyes,
deep set in their heads, and their sight is perhaps keener
than that of any other member of the human race. When a
boomerang fell at a distance they would run as fast as they
could until near the place, then stand perfectly still for a
moment, like a hunting dog, make a dive into the bushes,
and reappear with the boomerang in the hand. One little
fellow was hit in the calf of his leg while standing thus.
It was a bad cut and bled freely. He disappeared among
the humpies without a whimper, soon coming out again with
a bandage of rags around the wounded leg.</p>

<p>It was now late afternoon. I knew the blacks liked to
get in under cover before dark, so, with a half-crown to
Long Green, some cakes for the little bushy heads, and
good-bys, I walked off like a veritable savage, grasping
firmly my newly made aboriginal boomerang.</p>

<p>If the boys of ten or fifteen years ago could have secured such thoroughly good adventure stories, of such
great length, at five cents per copy, the <b>Brave and Bold Weekly</b>, had it been published then, would have
had ten times its present large circulation. You see, in those days, stories of the quality of those now published
in the <b>Brave and Bold Weekly</b> were bound in cloth covers or else published little by little in boys’
serial papers, under which circumstances each story was paid for at the rate of one dollar or more.</p>

<p>Now we give the boys of America the opportunity of getting the same stories and better ones for five cents.
Do you not think it is a rare bargain? Just buy any one of the titles listed below and read it; you will not be
without <b>Brave and Bold</b> afterward. Each story is complete in itself and has no connection whatever with
any story that was published either before or after it.</p>

<p>We give herewith a list of all of the back numbers in print. You can have your newsdealer order them or
they will be sent direct by the publishers to any address upon receipt of the price in money or postage stamps.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
